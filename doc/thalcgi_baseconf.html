<h2 id="conf_file">Configuration file<p></h2>
</p>
<p>There's one thing you should keep in mind configuring the CGI program.  The
web server runs CGIs in directories where they are, so whenever the CGI
receives control, its current working directory is the directory where the
binary resides.  This fact is actively used from the very start:
<strong>the program expects to find its configuration file
(<code>thalcgi.ini</code>) in its current working directory, which
effectively means it must be placed in the same directory with the
<code>thalcgi.cgi</code> binary itself</strong>.
</p>
<p>As usual, the file is in the <a href="ini_basics.html">ini format</a>.
</p>
<p>In the present version, the configuration file name is hardcoded.  If you
<strong>really</strong> need it to either have another name or be located
elsewhere, then either edit the file <code>thalcgi.cpp</code> (see the
<code>THALASSA_CGI_CONFIG_PATH</code> macro near the start of the file) and
rebuild, or simply build with
<code>-DTHALASSA_CGI_CONFIG_PATH="your/path/file.ini"</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: the configuration file must be kept private as it contains
a secret for checking the captcha.</strong>  Okay, the most serious harm
you can get by leaking your <code>thalcgi.ini</code> is that someone
circumvents your captcha, well, unless you place something more sensitive
in your configuration file on your own, but you don't, do you?   Anyway,
please don't underestimate the possible consequences.  Unfortunately
enough, the file has to be placed inside your web space, so certain care
must be taken in order not to expose it to arbitrary people through your
web server.  It is strongly recommended to use <code>suexec</code> so that
your CGIs are executed under UID/GID other than your web server's, and keep
the configuration file readable to its owner only (e.g., mode
<code>0600</code>).
</p>
<p class="remark">The CGI program even performs a check at every start.
In case the current UID differs from the UID of the configuration file's
owner, it assumes there's no <code>suexec</code> (perhaps we're running
under the UID of the HTTP server) and aborts the check letting the things
go.  It doesn't mean everything's fine, but hardly the simple program can
do anything about it.  If, however, the UIDs are equal, the program checks
if there are any permissions for the configuration file for
<em>others</em>, and refuses to continue if so.  A built-in error page is
sent to the client.  In case you see it, do something like
<code>chmod&nbsp;o-rwx&nbsp;thalcgi.ini</code> to fix the problem.  If you
place your <code>thalcgi.ini</code> into your web space with the help of
the <code>thalassa</code> program (e.g., as a <a href="verbatim_publishing.html#binary_section">binary object</a>), which is
recommended, be sure to place &ldquo;<code>chmod&nbsp;=&nbsp;600</code>&rdquo; into
the binary configuration section.<p></p>
</p>


<h2 id="macros">CGI-specific macros<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Just like the <code>thalassa</code> program, the CGI program actively uses
<a href="macro_intro.html">macros</a> in its configuration file.  Besides
the <a href="common_macros.html">common macros</a>, there are some
CGI-specific macros, only available in the <code>thalcgi.ini</code> file,
and, certainly, in some contexts there are context-specific macros as well.
</p>
<p>Some of these are directly related to particular features such as pages,
sessions, comments and so on; such macros will be documented along with the
respective features.  However, some of the CGI-specific macros don't fall
into any of the feature-specific categories.  To keep the picture
consistent, we'll document them right here.
</p>
<p><span id="req_macro"></span>
The <code>%[req:&nbsp]</code> macro provides access to certain properties
of the HTTP request being handled.  As usual, its first parameter must be
the name of a <em>function</em>; the following functions are supported:
</p>
<ul>

<li><code>%[req:method]</code> returns the request method, which is either
<code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>; other request methods s are not
supported by the Thalassa CGI program, so the control will not reach the
program parts that expand this macro;</li>

<li><code>%[req:document_root]</code> is the filesystem path to the
server's <em>Document Root</em>, as it is thought of by your HTTP
server;</li>

<li><code>%[req:host]</code>, <code>%[req:script]</code> and
<code>%[req:path]</code> return the respective parts of the URL from the
request being served; e.g., if the user requests something like
<code>http://www.example.com/cgi/thalcgi.cgi/foo/bar</code>, then the three
functions will return <code>www.example.com</code>,
<code>/cgi/thalcgi.cgi</code> and <code>/foo/bar</code>, respectively;</li>

<li><code>%[req:port]</code> returns the TCP port number being used,
usually this is 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, but not necessarily, because
any TCP server, including a web server, technically can be run on any TCP
port;</li>

<li><code>%[req:param:<em>NAME</em>]</code> returns the &ldquo;query parameter&rdquo;
of the given name, or an empty string if there's no such parameter;</li>

<li><code>%[req:cookie:<em>NAME</em>]</code> returns the given cookie's
value or an empty string if there's no such cookie; note that Thalassa CMS
only sets and handles one cookie, named <code>thalassa_sessid</code>, but
this function still can be useful in case you run other CGI scripts on your
site and they set/handle something else.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p><span id="getenv_macro"></span>
The <code>%[getenv:&nbsp]</code> macro gives access to the environment
variables; actually it is just a wrapper for a well-known
<code>getenv</code> function from the standart C library.  It accepts
exactly one argument, the name of the variable, and returns the respective
value, or an empty string in case the variable is empty or unset; there's
no way to tell these apart.  As the CGI protocol makes heavy use of the
environment, this macro becomes an important tool, specially in case some
information you need for some reason is not available through the
<code>%[req:]</code> macro.
</p>


<h2 id="global_conf">Configuring global parameters<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The global parameters are set within the <code>[general]</code> section.
As of the present, three parameters are expected:
<code>userdata_dir</code>, <code>post_content_limit</code> and
<code>post_param_limit</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>userdata_dir</code> sets the path to the
<a href="thalcgi_overview.html#database">database directory</a>, where
sessions, user accounts and other dynamic information is stored.
The path must be either absolute (not recommended), or relative to the
CGI's working directory (which is, let's repeat it, the directory where the
CGI binary is placed).
</p>
<p>It's better to place the database directory outside of your web tree, so
the path will start with one or more &ldquo;<code>../</code>&rdquo;.  Make sure the
directory is available for &ldquo;write&rdquo; and &ldquo;execute&rdquo; for the CGI program
(that is, for the UID/GID under which the CGI runs).  The directory itself
must exist, which means you must make it, the program won't do this for
you; however, it will create all necessary subdirectories and all work
files inside.
</p>
<p>The other two parameters, <code>post_content_limit</code> and
<code>post_param_limit</code>, are intended to limit the size of what the
client can send within a POST request; both parameters set the default
value which can be overriden on a per-page basis (with parameters with the
same name within the <code>[page&nbsp;]</code> configuration section), and
both are given as integers, in kilobytes (damn, a kilobyte is 1024 bytes,
don't trust anyone who tries to convince you otherwise).  The
<code>post_content_limit</code> is the maximum size of the POST request
body, which means that in case the value of the <code>CONTENT_LENGTH</code>
environment variable is greater than this value times 1024, the CGI refuses
to work and displays the respective error page.
</p>
<p>The funny thing about the <code>post_param_limit</code> is that it is
completely ignored by the current Thalassa CGI version, because the present
version doesn't handle the <code>multipart/form-data</code> POST body
format (which is used for forms that upload files).
</p>


<h2 id="html_section">HTML snippets and templates<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Just like the <code>thalassa</code> program configuration, the
<code>thalcgi.ini</code> can (and perhaps <em>should</em>) contain the
<code>[html]</code> section, in which HTML snippets and simple templates
are defined.  The snippets and templates can be accessed by
<code>%[html:<em>snippet_name</em>]</code> macro calls.
</p>
<p>Both the ini file section and the macro work exactly the same way as in the
<code>thalassa</code> program; please refer to the
<a href="general_configuration.html#html_section"><code>[html]</code>
section description</a> for details and examples.
</p>


<h2 id="error_page">The error page<p></h2>
</p>
<p>In case something goes wrong, the CGI program has to display an <em>error
page</em>.  For the case there are problems with the configuration file,
e.g., it doesn't exist, unreadable or is in wrong format, the program uses
a built-in template for the error page.  The same is true for the case you
didn't specify your custom template for the error page, but it is strongly
not recommended to rely on that.
</p>
<p>The custom error page template is set by creating a
<code>[errorpage]</code> section, which is presently supposed to contain
only one parameter, named <code>template</code>.  The parameter's value is
passed through the macroprocessor to make the actual HTML code.  Two
context-specific macros are available within the template:
<code>%errcode%</code> expands to the 3-digit error code (like 404 for
&ldquo;page not found&rdquo;), and <code>%errmessage%</code> expands to the error
message, as composed by the program.
</p>
<p>In the present version all messages are hardcoded, which is likely to
change in the future.
</p>


<h2 id="special_pages">Special pages<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Error page is one of the three <em>special pages</em> supported by
Thalassa.  In contrast to ordinary pages, special pages are not bound to
particular paths; by they nature, they can be displayed in place of any
other page in case Thalasa CGI can't (or is not allowed to) display what the
user requests.  The two other special pages are
<code>[nocookiepage]</code>, which is displayed instead of the requested
page in case the page requires a work session to be active but the user
doesn't have one, and <code>[retrycaptchapage]</code>, displayed when the user
tried to solve the CAPTCHA test but failed.  Both pages are supposed to
contain the CAPTCHA test challenge and the input form to submit the answer.
The two pages will be documented along with session handling.
