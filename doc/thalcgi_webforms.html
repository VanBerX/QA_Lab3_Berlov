<h2 id="post_capable_pages">Pages accepting <code>POST</code> requests<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Thalassa CGI has built-in support for several webforms, or, strictly
speaking, for several fixed sets of parameters sent with a
<code>POST</code> request.  With the exception of
<code>command=setcookie</code> case, all other forms are handled
in a unified manner.  To handle a form, a
<a href="thalcgi_pages.html">page</a> must be configured; each of the
configured pages (actually, <code>[page&nbsp;]</code> ini sections,
including these multipath ones) may either handle one of the predefined
forms, or none of them.
</p>
<p>A page intended to handle a form must have the <code>post_allowed</code>
parameter set to <code>yes</code>.  In most cases the page should also have
a non-empty value for the <code>action</code> parameter.  This is not a
requirement, so you can have a page that accepts <code>POST</code> requests
but does nothing, only shows some HTML; using macros, primarily the
<code>%[req:param:&nbsp;]</code> macro function, a lot of things can be
done, but it is all about generating the HTML response, not actually
performing anything.
</p>
<p>Please note all configured pages also accept <code>GET</code> requests, and
there's no way to tell the CGI not to accept them.  In most cases it is
convenient to show the user the corresponding web form when the page
intended to handle it is requested with the <code>GET</code> method.
If, however, you for any reason decide otherwise, it is still possible to
use conditional macros and the <code>%[req:method]</code> function just to
tell the user (s)he shouldn't have reached this page in this way.
</p>


<h2 id="list_of_actions">What actions are supported<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <code>action</code> parameter's value must consist of the action name
and arguments, much like a command line; there's a fixed set of action
names supported by the CGI program, each of them expects a fixed set of
form input values.  In the present version, the following actions are
supported: </p>
<ul>

<li><code>rmsession</code> &mdash; <em>remove session</em>; if there's an
active session, it is removed (that is, its file is deleted from the
database directory), and a cookie removal request is sent to the client;</li>

<li><code>login</code> performs two different functions typically requested
from the same webform: either validates the supplied login name and a
single use password, and logs the user in if the validation is passed, or
generates new single-use passwords for the requesting user and sends them
by email;</li>

<li><code>signup</code> processes a new user registration application;</li>

<li><code>profile</code> updates the user's profile data, such as the
visible name and the web site URL;</li>

<li><code>changemail</code> processes the user's request for changing their
active email;</li>

<li><code>feedback</code> sends an email to one of the predefined email
addresses (performs the function of a site-wide contact form);</li>

<li><code>comment_add</code> adds a new comment for the given page,
assigning it a comment ID;</li>

<li><code>comment_edit</code> can perform any of the following:
<ul>
  <li>replace the given comment's title and body;</li>
  <li>remove the given comment;</li>
  <li>hide a previously visible comment;</li>
  <li>show a previously hidden comment, removing it from the moderation
      queue if it was there;</li>
  <li>remove the comment from the moderation queue without showing it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Only <code>feedback</code>, <code>comment_add</code> and
<code>comment_edit</code> accept arguments; for example, &ldquo;<code>feedback
techsupport</code>&rdquo; as the action parameter's value means a feedback
category &ldquo;techsupport&rdquo; must be preselected in the feedback web form.  For
the rest of actions, the action value consists of only one word &mdash; the
action name itself.  Later on, we'll document each of the actions together
with their arguments, if any, and the web form parameters they accept.
</p>


<h2 id="post_result">Handling a <code>POST</code> request's result<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Once a <code>POST</code> request is received, the CGI first performs
whatever actions are requested, and only then generates and sends back the
response page.  So, at the time of the HTML generation, it is already
known what has just been done and was it successful or not.  This result
obviously should be communicated to the user somehow.
</p>
<p>From the Thalassa CGI's point of view, the action result consists of two
things: a message and a boolean value that reflects whether the requested
action successfully done.
</p>
<p>There's one important thing to take into account.  Even when you expect
your page to be displayed as a response for a <code>GET</code> request, but
the page is configured to require an active session, it can end up being
displayed <strong>as a result of a set-cookie <code>POST</code>
request</strong>.  In this case the request is known to be successful,
otherwise the user would see the Retry Captcha special page instead;
however, you should be prepared to this.  For instance, you should check
for presence of a message and include it in your page in case it is there,
even if your page is not intended to handle <code>POST</code> requests at
all &mdash; but nonetheless requires the session to be established.
</p>
<p>And, well, don't be too surprized if the <code>%[req:method]</code> returns
&ldquo;<code>POST</code>&rdquo; on a page configured as POST-uncapable.  If it
requires an active session, you now know why such strange things happen
sometime.
</p>



   <h3 id="post_result_messages">The messages<p></h3>
</p>
<p>There's a fixed set of messages; the CGI program identifies them with
names, hopefully self-descriptive, such as <code>new_values_saved</code>
or <code>comment_deleted</code>.  The particular wording for each of the
messages is configurable; furthermore, in the present version there are no
defaults for them, so one <em>must</em> configure all messages.  To do so,
the <code>[message]</code> ini section is used; every parameter in this
section has a name that corresponds to a message name, and the value is the
actual text of the message.  Here's an example of the section with values
for all messages used by Thalassa CGI; certainly you can choose your own
wording or translate the messages to another language, but this example is
nonetheless useful:
</p>
<pre>
  [message]
  server_side_error = Server side error.  Please report this
      to the site owner.
  cookie_set = Cookie has been set, session established.
      The interactive features of the site are now available to you.
  cookie_removed = Session closed, cookie removed.
  field_not_filled = Some of mandatory fields are not filled in.
  logged_in = Logged in successfully.
  wrong_login_password = Wrong user id or password.
  login_unknown = User id unknown.
  invalid_login_name = The user id is not acceptable.
      Please choose another user id.
  login_not_available = The user id already exists or blocked.
      Please choose another user id.
  pass_req_too_early = You still have some passwords left and
      less than 24 hours passed since they were sent.
      Please try again later.
  invalid_email_address = Invalid format of email address.
  email_already_used = This email address is user by an existing
      user of the site.  If you forgot your user id, please contact
      the site administrators.
  email_belonged_to_other = This email address was once confirmed
      to belong to another user.  The system doesn't allow to
      change ownership of emails; if you've got a reason for it,
      please contact the site administration.
  email_recently_tried = Someone recently tried to register a user
      using this email, but didn't confirm it.  To prevent flooding
      of innocent mailboxes, the site blocks repeated registration
      messages to the same address for a certain time.
  email_banned = This address or its domain name is on the
      stop-list.
  changemail_too_early = Recently you already requested to change
      your address.  Please try again later.
  changemail_canceled = Email change request cancelled.
  invalid_feedback_category = The given feedback category is not
      configured.  Please report this error to the site owner.
  email_sent_to_you = Message to your email address
      successfully sent.
  your_email_sent = Your email successfully sent.

      Sorry for the inconvenience.
  new_values_saved = New values saved.
  email_changed = Your email address changed.
  wrong_confirmation_code = Wrong confirmation code.
  not_really_confirm = Not confirmed.  To confirm the request
      you need to enter the word &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
      into the confirmation input field.
  comment_deleted = Comment deleted.
  comment_queued_for_premod = Your comment has been queued
      for moderation.
  comment_saved = Comment submitted.
  page_regenerated = Page regenerated.
  not_logged_in = Logged in users only.
  not_this_way = This doesn't work this way :-)
  permission_denied = Permission denied.
  anon_denied = Anonymous users are not allowed to do this.
  not_implemented_yet = The feature is not implemented yet.
  bug_in_the_code = There's a bug in the site's implementation.
      Please report this to the site's owner.
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The exact situations when each of the messages is used will be explained
together with their respective actions.
</p>


   <h3 id="post_result_macros">Macros accessing action result<p></h3>
</p>
<p>A handful of macros is used to access a <code>POST</code> request status.
The <code>%message%</code> expands to the
<a href="#post_result_messages"><code>POST</code> result message</a>, as
configured in the <code>[message]</code> section, if such message exists;
otherwise (e.g. if the page is being generated in response to a
<code>GET</code> request, not <code>POST</code>), the macro returns an empty
string.
</p>
<p>The <code>ifmessage</code>, <code>ifmessageok</code>,
<code>ifactresult</code> and <code>ifactresultok</code> macros are
condition checkers; they all accept exactly two arguments, the
<em>then</em> value and the <em>else</em> value, and return the former in
case the condition is true and the latter if it is false.
</p>
<p>For the <code>%[ifmessage:&nbsp;]</code> macro, the condition being checked
is whether there's a message, that is, would the <code>%message%</code>
return a non-empty string if we call it.
</p>
<p>The <code>%[ifmessageok:&nbsp;]</code> macro checks whether the result is
present <strong>and it is a success</strong>.
</p>
<p>The <code>%[ifactresult:&nbsp;]</code> macro checks whether we have a
result of <strong>the action configured for this page</strong>.  This is
different from the question <em>if we've got a message</em> in that in case
we're composing the page <em>as a result of successful passing of the
CAPTCHA and establishing the session</em>.  If it is a CAPTCHA success,
then the <code>ifmessage</code>'s (and even the <code>ifmessageok</code>'s)
condition is true, but the <code>ifactresult</code>'s condition is false.
</p>
<p>The <code>%[ifactresultok:&nbsp;]</code> macro's condition is if there's an
action result (as for the <code>ifactresult</code> macro) <strong>and it is
successful</strong>.
</p>
<p>For example, your template for the page which accepts <code>POST</code>
requests may include something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  %[ifmessage:&lt;div
    class="msgbox_%[ifmessageok:ok:err]"&gt;%message%&lt;/div&gt;]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>&mdash; while your CSS can have the respective classes, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  .msgbox_ok {
    border: 2px solid #00b000;
    margin: auto;
    width: 75%;
  }
  .msgbox_err {
    border: 2px solid #b00000;
    margin: auto;
    width: 75%;
  }
<p></pre>
</p>

<h2 id="action_rmsession">Session removal action<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <code>rmsession</code> action is perhaps the simplest one among actions
supported by Thalassa CGI, but it can serve as a good example on how all
the machinery works.  The action doesn't accept any arguments, and,
furthermore, it doesn't need any parameters from the webform that sends
the <code>POST</code> request.  This effectively means the form may consist
of the submit button only; its duty is to form an (empty!)
<code>POST</code> request directed to the desired page &mdash; the one you
use for the <code>rmsession</code> action.
</p>
<p>Let's name the page <code>/rmspage</code>.  In a real life situation you
might want to name it more intuitively, like <code>/remore_session</code>,
<code>/close_session</code> or even just <code>/rmsession</code>, it is
still okay, but in our example it is better to make the action name and the
page name differ &mdash; just to avoid confusion.  So, the page is
available at <code>/rmspage</code> <em>under</em> the path to your CGI; we
don't assume any particular location for the CGI, instead we just use the
path we were called through, which is available as
<code>%[req:script]</code>.  The web form that removes the session and the
cookie may then look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;form name="rmform" action="%[req:script]/rmspage" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Close your session" /&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Note that the form name (<code>rmform</code> in this example) doesn't
matter anything special, you can name it whatever you want.  Also, you can
place this form on any of the pages your CGI generates, or even on all of
them.  It may be useful to check whether the session actually exist and
only display the form if it does.  It is also possible to place the form on
any of your static pages, but this is not recommended, because, first,
you'll be unable to use the <code>%[req:script]</code> macro which is
CGI-specific, so you'll have to mention the full URI explicitly, and,
second, on static pages you can't <em>check</em> anything so your visitors
will see the form even when they don't have any sessions.
</p>
<p>The <code>/rmspage</code> page configuration can then look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  [page /rmspage]
  session_required = no
  embedded = no
  post_allowed = yes
  action = rmsession
  template = %html:header%
  +%[ifmessage:&lt;div
  +   class="msgbox_%[ifmessageok:ok:err]"&gt;%message%&lt;/div&gt;]
  +%[sess|ifvalid|&lt;p&gt;Session is active&lt;/p&gt;
  +  &lt;form name="rmform" action="%[req:script]/rmspage" method="POST"&gt;
  +  &lt;input type="submit" value="Close your session" /&gt;
  +  &lt;/form&gt;
  +   |
  +  &lt;p&gt;Cookie is not set, no session&lt;/p&gt;
  +]
  +%html:footer%
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>In this example we placed the cookie removal request form on the same page,
so that if the browser is directed to the page (that is, to the URI like
<code>/thalcgi.cgi/rmspage</code>) with a usual <code>GET</code> request
(that is, with a regular link, not a web form), the user will see the
<code>Close your session</code> button if there's a session, and the
message <code>Cookie is not set, no session</code> otherwise.  For the case
of a <code>POST</code> request, the user will see the message box at the
top of the page, which will either say that the cookie has just been
successfully removed, or that there's no cookie and no session to close.  In
both cases, the page itself (under the message box) will consist of a
single paragraph saying <code>Cookie is not set, no session</code>;
this is because the cookie either didn't exist, or has been removed,
anyways there's no cookie here and now.
