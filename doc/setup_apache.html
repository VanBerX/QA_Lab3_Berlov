<h2 id="intro">Scope and limitations of this instruction<p></h2>
</p>
<p>This page gives a step-by-step instruction how to set up a fresh Linux
machine to serve a Thalassa-based site with the well-known Apache HTTP
server.  It is assumed that your site is based on the Smoky template, but
some advices are given for non-template sites as well.
</p>
<p>Instructions are given assuming Debian or a Debian-like distribution.  On
machines with other distros, the things may look slightly different.  This
question is addressed somehow, too, but obviously it is not possible to
provide a step-by-step instruction covering all possible distros and
systems.
</p>
<p>All HTTPS-related stuff is deliberately ignored here.  If you really
want/need HTTPS with all its certificates, trusted authorities and all the
stuff, well, there are tons of sources on how to make Apache serve it.
</p>
<p>If for some reason you don't need interactive features of Thalassa, then
the simplest way to organize thing will be perhaps to generate the site on
your own machine and upload the results to the server; deployment of a
completely static site has no Thalassa-specific issues and is not addressed
here.  The tricky part is to make Apache run the
<a href="thalcgi_overview.html">Thalassa CGI program</a> properly.
</p>
<p>There are three possible configurations for Apache to run a Thalassa-based
site:</p>
<ul>
<li>without virtual hosts;</li>
<li>with virtual hosts that belong to the same user, without
<code>suexec</code>;</li>
<li>with virtual hosts, using <code>suexec</code>.</li>
<p></ul>
</p>
<p>The last one may look the most tricky, but from the other hand it is
the most flexible and secure one.  In case there are several people running
their sites on a single server machine (no matter if it is physical or
virtual), the <code>suexec</code>-based configuration becomes the only
possible option; however, even if you run only one site on your server, it
is still much better to run it as a virtual site with <code>suexec</code>,
so that the CGI program will execute under a (dummy) user different from
the one used for Apache itself.  So this one is highly recommended.
</p>

<h2 id="common">Common preparations<p></h2>
</p>
<h3 id="get_thalassa_binaries">Getting Thalassa binaries<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Generally, there are two ways of getting Thalassa binaries ready to run on
your server box: either to build them from sources right on the server, or
build it on your computer and upload to the server.  Yes, this
<strong><em>IS</em></strong> possible, as Thalassa is built fully-static by
default.
</p>
<p>In order <strong>to build Thalassa from sources</strong> (which is not
necessary in most cases!), you'll need the GNU C++ compiler and GNU make;
install them with smth. like this
</p>
<pre>
  apt install gcc g++ make
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>and follow <a href="overview.html#build">the instruction</a>; then, as
<code>root</code>, copy your binaries to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> (this
step is not required, but in the rest of this text we assume you did it):
</p>
<pre>
  cd thalassa_0.3.00/cms
  cp thalassa thalcgi.cgi /usr/local/bin
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>However, even though Thalassa doesn't need any external libraries and weird
tools to build, installing even the minimal C++ toolchain on a low-end VPS
may considerably reduce the amount of available disk space, so you might
want to avoid having it on your server.  For most of programs around, you
can't copy executable binaries from one computer to another, but for
Thalassa, this approach works.  The only limitation is that both computers
must be of the same processor architecture and must run the same OS kernel
type (okay, sometimes these may differ and copying the binaries will still
work, but in this instruction we will not discuss things like
cross-compiling, architecture backwards compatibility, foreign binary
interfaces and the like).  To check if they match, issue the
<code>uname&nbsp;-mo</code> command on both boxes.  Most probably, in both
cases you'll see &ldquo;<code>x86_64 GNU/Linux</code>&rdquo;; this means
everything's good (well, if you see something else, but occasionally the
same thing on both boxes, then everything is okay, too, but hardly this
will happen in real life).
</p>
<p>So, build Thalassa following <a href="overview.html#build">the
instruction</a> on your working machine (e.g., your home computer or your
office workstation), then do something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  cd thalassa_0.3.00/cms
  scp thalassa thalcgi.cgi root@your-server.example.com:/usr/local/bin
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>To check if they really work, login to your server and try launching the
<code>thalassa</code> program, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
  thalassa show version
<p></pre>
</p>


<h3 id="install_apache">Installing Apache and getting it to run<p></h3>
</p>
<p>On Debian-like distros, Apache is installed like this:
</p>
<pre>
  apt install apache2
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>If your system is <code>systemd</code>-based (which is highly likely in
these insane days), try launching Apache with smth. like
</p>
<pre>
  systemctl start apache2
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>If you're lucky enough and your server runs a non-systemd system, you'll
need a different command to start your Apache, like
</p>
<pre>
  service apache2 start
  service apache start
  service httpd start
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>or even
</p>
<pre>
  apachectl start
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Then, point your browser to your server's address, and you should see the
default Apache web page.
</p>
<p>Please note that in Debian and its company, the Apache's configuration is
found in <code>/etc/apache2</code>, the <code>/var/www</code> directory is
considered the &ldquo;<em>web root</em>&rdquo; (<code>/var/www/html</code>
being the default site's location), and Apache runs under the
<code>www-data</code> account (dummy user).  In other distros and systems
the things may be different; it is useful to figure out everything in
advance.
</p>
<p>For a Thalassa-based site, you need to enable at least the Apache's
<code>mod_cgi</code> module, and it is useful (although not strictly
required) to enable <code>mod_rewrite</code> as well.  In Debian, it's is
done like this:
</p>
<pre>
  cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
  ln -s ../mods-available/cgi.load .
  ln -s ../mods-available/rewrite.load .
<p></pre>
In other circumstances, you might need to place the following line
</p>
<pre>
  LoadModule cgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_cgi.so
<p></pre>
somewhere in the Apache's configuration (the symlink chemistry shown just
above actually does exactly this, only in a weird manner).  Just look
through what you have to figure out where other <code>LoadModule</code>
directives are placed (or simply <code>grep ^LoadModule -R *</code>), and
add this one.
</p>
<p>Finally, uncomment and edit the <code>ServerName</code> directive for your
site.  In Debian and friends, it is in the
<code>sites-available/000-default.conf</code> file, within the
&ldquo;default&rdquo; site configuration.  Make it look like
</p>
<pre>
          ServerName www.example.com
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>It is might also be useful to let Apache know for sure how your
<em>server</em> (that is, the machine, as opposite to the <em>site</em>) is
named.  To do so, add to your <code>apache2.conf</code> a line like this:
</p>
<pre>
  ServerName your-server.example.com
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>There's one more thing to address.  The CGI configuration files, named
<code>thalassa.ini</code>, have to reside within your web tree (side by
side with the CGI programs they tune), but they must never be leaked though
the web server, like normal (.html and other) files do.  If you're going to
use a <code>suexec</code>-based configuration, this problem is solved with
properly set permissions, and the <code>thalcgi.cgi</code> program even
refuses to run until you set the permissions for its configuration file
properly.  If, however, you're not going to use <code>suexec</code>
(thus disregarding all our recommendations), you must take some other
actions to protect these files.  The Smoky template does that from the
<code>.htaccess</code> files it generates, but even if you do use Smoky,
these <code>.htaccess</code> files may occasionally get disabled and
disregarded; and if you don't use Smoky, it is very easy to leave one of
your <code>thalcgi.ini</code> files exposed to the whole Internet.  So, it
may be not a bad idea to add the following to your Apache configuration:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;FilesMatch "^thalcgi\.ini$"&gt;
          Require all denied
  &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Be sure to run <code>apachectl restart</code> for your changes to take
effect.
</p>


<h2 id="singlesite">Configuration for a single site<p></h2>
</p>
<p>One of the simplest approaches is to place your site's source (that is,
configuration files and other stuff used by Thalassa) side-by-side with
that <code>html</code> directory (that is, make a dir like
<code>/var/www/Site</code> for your site's source), and make the whole
<code>/var/www</code> <em>owned</em> by Apache (the <code>www-data</code>
account in case of Debian), and perform all site maintenance tasks as that
user.
</p>
<p>You will also need a directory for your
<a href="thalcgi_overview.html#database">session database</a>.  We'll use
<code>/var/www/_site</code> directory for this purpose.
</p>
<p class="remark">Letting the whole <code>/var/www</code> tree be owned by
the <code>www-data</code> user is terribly risky.  If some bad guys manage
to establish control over your Apache, they will have write access not only
to your site, but to your site sources as well, and the worst thing here is
that all this may remain unnoticed for a long period.  However, we cant't
follow the usual permissions scheme in which the files placed in the web
space are owned by another user and are only readable for Apache (actually,
they are typically made world-readable, thus Apache being just one of these
<em>others</em>).  This is because, as long as we don't use
<code>suexec</code>, the CGI programs are launched by Apache with the same
credentials as it has itself, <em>and</em> the Thalassa CGI program must
be able to update the files within the web space.  If you want a secure
configuration, please give up this single-site, no-suexec approach in favor
of the <a href="#suexec">suexec-based configuration</a>.  Yes, it
<strong>does</strong> make sense even in case you only run one site on your
server.<p></p>
</p>
<p>We will assume you're going to use the Smoky template; it's a good starting
point anyway.
</p>
<p>Assuming the <code>Site</code> directory isn't there yet, do the following
(as root):
</p>
<pre>
  cp -R /your/sources/of/thalassa/example/templ_smoky /var/www/Site
  mkdir /var/www/_site
  chown www-data /var/www -R
  chmod ugo+rX /var/www -R
  chmod 700 /var/www/_site
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>From now on, you will only need root access to modify the configuration of
Apache, while all manipulations with the site's content can be done with
the Apache user's (<code>www-data</code> in our example) permissions.
If the command <code>su - www-data</code> fails, you might need to change
the login shell for the <code>www-data</code> user in your
<code>/etc/passwd</code>.
</p>
<p>Prepare your site for generation; if you use Smoky, follow the instructions
found in the README file; in particular, set at least the following in your
<code>config.ini</code>:
</p>
<pre>
  [options dir]
  target = ../html
  spool = ../_site/_spool
  thalcgi = /usr/local/bin/thalcgi.cgi

  [options site]
  url = http://www.example.com    <em>whatever is the URL of your site</em>
  briefname = example.com

  [options cgi]
  userdbdir = ../_site
  sitesrc = ../Site
  thalassa_bin = /usr/local/bin/thalassa
  secret = YOUR_VERY_SECRET_PIECE_OF_JUNK

  [general]
  opt_selector:feed = news
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Be sure to pay attention to other configurable options as well.  The
parameters listed above may be more important in the sense your site will
not work without them, but that's no reason to ignore everything else.
</p>
<p>Launch the <code>thalassa gen -r</code> command <em>in your
<code>Site</code> directory</em> and check if the
<code>/var/www/html</code> directory is now populated with files.
Actually, your site must be reachable now, showing all the static content,
but the CGI program is still unable to run.
</p>
<p>As root, edit your <code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code>.  Find the
default <code>Directory</code> directives, which usually looks like this:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /&gt;
          Options FollowSymLinks
          AllowOverride None
          Require all denied
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /usr/share&gt;
          AllowOverride None
          Require all granted
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /var/www/&gt;
          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
          AllowOverride None
          Require all granted
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Add the following here:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /var/www/_site&gt;
          Require all denied
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /var/www/Site&gt;
          Require all denied
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /var/www/html&gt;
          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCgi
          AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
          AllowOverride All
          Require all granted
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Now restart your Apache, and everything should work.
</p>

<h2 id="nosuexec">Configuration with virtual sites but without <code>suexec</code><p></h2>
</p>
<p>This is perhaps the ugliest thing possible.  Only one Apache user (that
poor <code>www-data</code>) is available, so you can't give different users
of your system access to different sites.  You can't, e.g., invite friends to
use your Linux box, and this is weird, because even the lowest-end-possible
VPS is capable of running hundreds of Thalassa-based sites.
</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're affraid of <code>suexec</code> that much, what we'd
suggest is to create 3 subdirectories under your <code>/var/www</code> for
every site you're going to run: e.g., if your site is identified somehow by
the word <code>foobar</code> (e.g., it is
<code>http://www.foobar.example.com</code>, well, you've got the idea),
then let the <code>/var/www/foobar</code> directory be your site's web
tree, place your site's source in <code>/var/www/Foobar</code> and also be
sure to make an empty directory named <code>/var/www/_foobar</code> for the
session database.  This may (and should) be done as the
<code>www-data</code> user.
</p>
<p>Indeed, your <code>config.ini</code> should now be slightly different:
</p>
<pre id="config_ini_for_virtuals">
  [options dir]
  target = ../foobar
  spool = ../_foobar/_spool
  thalcgi = /usr/local/bin/thalcgi.cgi

  [options site]
  url = http://www.foobar.example.com
  briefname = foobar.example.com

  [options cgi]
  userdbdir = ../_foobar
  sitesrc = ../Foobar
  thalassa_bin = /usr/local/bin/thalassa
  secret = YOUR_VERY_SECRET_PIECE_OF_JUNK

  [general]
  opt_selector:feed = news
<p></pre>
</p>

<p>Next, as root, create an Apache configuration file for your site.
Here's an example:
</p>
<pre id="virtual_site_conf_nosuexec">
  &lt;Directory /var/www/_foobar&gt;
          Require all denied
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /var/www/Foobar&gt;
          Require all denied
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /var/www/foobar&gt;
          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCgi
          AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
          AllowOverride All
          Require all granted
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
          ServerName foobar.example.com
          ServerAlias foobur.example.com www.foobar.example.com

          ServerAdmin webmaster@remove-this-crap.foobar.example.com
          DocumentRoot /var/www/foobar

          ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
          CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>If your system uses that debian-style configuration, save the file as
<code>/etc/apache2/sites-available/001-foobar.html</code> (or, you can pick
<code>002-</code>, <code>003-</code> etc, in case the <code>001-</code>
prefix is already taken).  Then, go to your <code>sites-enabled</code>
directory and make the appropriate symlink:
</p>
<pre>
  cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
  ln -s ../sites-available/001-foobar.conf .
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>If you're not on a debian-like system, it is still useful to define each
virtual site in its own conf file.  You can include them one by one by
adding to your <code>apache2.conf</code> directives like
</p>
<pre>
  Include foobar.conf
<p></pre>
&mdash; or, alternatively, you can make a directory for these files, e.g.,
<code>/etc/apache2/virtuals/</code>, and include them all at once:
</p>
<pre>
  IncludeOptional virtuals/*.conf
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Everything should work when you restart your Apache.
</p>


<h2 id="suexec">Configuration with virtual sites and <code>suexec</code><p></h2>
</p>
<p><strong>Install the <code>suexec</code> program</strong>.  If
you use a Debian-based distro, you might want to use the <em>custom</em>
(in Debian's terms) version of <code>suexec</code>, installed like this:
</p>
<pre>
  apt install apache2 apache2-suexec-custom
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>However, the default <code>suexec</code> version (as provided by the
original Apache package) will work well too; if you decide to use that one,
install like this:
</p>
<pre>
  apt install apache2 apache2-suexec-pristine
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The following steps don't depend on which <code>suexec</code> you choose,
both will work.  On non-debian systems, there's usually no such option, but
there's nothing wrong in using the default <code>suexec</code>.
</p>

<p><strong>Enable the module</strong>.  In Debian, it's is done like this:
</p>
<pre>
  cd /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
  ln -s ../mods-available/suexec.load .
<p></pre>
In other circumstances, you might need to place the following line
</p>
<pre>
  LoadModule suexec_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_suexec.so
<p></pre>
somewhere in the Apache's configuration.  Whatever system you use, be sure
to add the following line to your <code>apache2.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre>
  Suexec on
<p></pre>
</p>

<p><strong>Set up the directory tree</strong>.
For this approach, we strongly recommend to create per-user directories
under your <code>/var/www/</code>, with per-site directories residing under
the users' directories of their owners.  For example, if the user
<code>lizzie</code> is going to run a site named <code>foobar</code>, then,
according to this layout paradigm, there must be the per-user directory
named <code>/var/www/lizzie/</code>, <em>and</em> the directories
<code>/var/www/lizzie/foobar</code>, <code>/var/www/lizzie/Foobar</code>
and <code>/var/www/lizzie/_foobar</code>, for the site web space, the site
sources (those files used by Thalassa to generate the site) and the
<a href="thalcgi_overview.html#database">session database</a> respectively.
<strong>The whole <code>/var/www/lizzie/</code> subtree must belong to the
user <code>lizzie</code>, and only the <code>/var/www/lizzie/foobar</code>
directory has to be world-readable</strong> (so that Apache can read it),
while the other two dirs (<code>Foobar</code> and <code>_foobar</code>) may
&mdash; and should &mdash; only be accessible for the owner.
You might want to make a symlink to <code>/var/www/lizzie/</code> from
within the <code>lizzie</code>'s home directory for the user's convenience;
we'll name the symlink &ldquo;<code>web</code>&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>To make the things as they should, do the following <em>as root</em>:
</p>
<pre>
  chown root:root /var/www
  chmod 755 /var/www
  mkdir /var/www/lizzie
  chown lizzie: /var/www/lizzie
  chmod 755 /var/www/lizzie
  ln -s /var/www/lizzie ~lizzie/web
<p></pre>
Then, <strong>login as <code>lizzie</code></strong>, and do the following:
</p>
<pre>
  cd ~/web
  cp -R /your/sources/of/thalassa/example/templ_smoky ./Foobar
  chmod 700 Foobar
  mkdir _foobar
  chmod 700 _foobar
<p></pre>
After that, <code>cd Foobar</code> and customize the Smoky template to fit
your needs, exactly <a href="#config_ini_for_virtuals">as we did it for the
non-suexec scheme with multiple sites</a>; as all paths are relative there,
nothing actually changes from Thalassa's content generator's point of
view.
</p>
<p><strong>Take care about permissions for your
<code>thalcgi.ini</code></strong>.  The Smoky template sets the appropriate
permissions for the <code>thalcgi.ini</code> file on its own, but if you
wrote your site ini files from scratch, make sure the file has the mode
<code>0600</code> in your web space.  You can copy the file to your web
space as a
&ldquo;<a href="verbatim_publishing.html#binary_section">binary</a>&rdquo;
or generate one as a &ldquo;<a href="simple_pages.html">page</a>&rdquo;
(note Smoky does exactly this); in both cases be sure to add
<code>chmod&nbsp;=&nbsp;700</code> to the appropriate section.
</p>
<p><strong>Tell your Apache to serve the site</strong>.  To make Apache
recognize (and serve) your site, prepare a virtual site description file in
a way similar to the one <a href="#virtual_site_conf_nosuexec">discussed
for the non-suexec approach</a>.  The file's content will be a bit
different, as you need to adjust the directories and to add the
<code>SuexecUserGroup</code> directive, which tells Apache which UID and
GID to use for the CGI &ldquo;scripts&rdquo; launched via
<code>suexec</code> for the particular site.  Assuming that
<code>lizzie</code>'s primary user group is <code>webadmin</code>, the
virtual site description for our example will become as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;Directory /var/www/lizzie/_foobar&gt;
          Require all denied
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /var/www/lizzie/Foobar&gt;
          Require all denied
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;Directory /var/www/lizzie/foobar&gt;
          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCgi
          AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
          AllowOverride All
          Require all granted
  &lt;/Directory&gt;

  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
          ServerName foobar.example.com
          ServerAlias foobur.example.com www.foobar.example.com

          ServerAdmin webmaster@remove-this-crap.foobar.example.com
          DocumentRoot /var/www/lizzie/foobar

          ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
          CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

          SuexecUserGroup lizzie webadmin
  &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
