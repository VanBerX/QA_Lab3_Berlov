<h2 id="overview">Overview<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The scriptpp (<em>Script Plus Plus</em>) is a relatively small C++ class
library written by Andrey V. Stolyarov, initially intended to replace the
well-known (and generally unusable) <code>std::string</code> class; as
years passed, the library became much more than just another string class
implementation.  The official web home page for scriptpp is
<a href="http://www.croco.net/software/scriptpp/">http://www.croco.net/software/scriptpp/</a>.
</p>
<p class="remark">Despite its name, the library generally has nothing to do
with scripting.  The name was based on a (wrong) assumption that script
programming, as a paradigm, consists of two basic things: using text
strings as the representation for all kinds of data, and extensively
relying on external programs and text streams.  The library was expected to
turn C++ into a kind of scripting language &mdash; that is,
<strong>not</strong> provide a scripting language to be used from within
C++ programs, but, in contrast, to enable people to use C++ itself for
scripting.  Well, as the author of this concept, I admit it was all wrong;
in reality, scripting is not about strings nor external programs, scripting
is about small and primitive programs (scripts) that control bigger and
more complicated programs, either <em>glueing</em> them (like Bourne Shell
and various other shells do), or running inside them, like, by the way, Tcl
was initially supposed to be used.  In both cases, a scripting language is
about interpreted execution, so C++, by its very nature, can not play this
role.  However, I, the author of scriptpp, realized all this stuff like 15
years after the first release of the library, and decided not to rename
anything.<p></p>
</p>
<p>Thalassa CMS uses the library for:</p>
<ul>

<li>handling strings, which means storing them, passing them around, in and
out of functions, composing, modifying, analysing, converting to numbers
and back, tokenizing and actually doing everything what is usually done
with strings in computer programs;</li>

<li>processing macros &mdash; well, yes, the
<a href="macro_intro.html">macroprocessor</a> used by Thalassa is
implemented by the scriptpp library;</li>

<li>reading and composing <a href="headed_text.html">headed text
files</a>;</li>

<li>reading text files and analysing text streams;</li>

<li>launching and controlling external programs.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Unluckily enough, there's actually almost no documentation for the library,
only some doxygen-style commentary inside its header files can explain
something about it.  The page you're now reading is in no way a replacement
for such documentation (which is still to be written), it is only here to
provide some glue on what's the hell is going on and how to deal with it.
</p>


<h2 id="scriptvariable"><code>ScriptVariable</code>: the string representation<p></h2>
</p>
<p>To get the <code>ScriptVariable</code> class available, one must
<code>#include &lt;scriptpp/scrvar.hpp&gt;</code> header file, which may be
considered the main header of the library, as all the other features
provided by the library actually depend on this class anyway.
</p>
<p>The <code>ScriptVariable</code> class is <strong>the</strong> replacement
for that <code>std::string</code>, so basically it has similar
functionality and even <em>some</em> compatibility features, such as the
<code>c_str()</code> method, which returns the respective
<code>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</code> value.  A&nbsp;converting constructor
from the <code>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</code> type is also available, as
well as an assignment operator accepting
<code>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</code> as the argument; the
default constructor creates an object holding empty string.
</p>
<p>The current length of the string can be obtained with the
<code>Length()</code> method, which is named accordingly to the
style generally used in the library, but there's a <em>compatibility</em>
alias <code>length()</code> as well.
</p>
<p>Just like these ``standard'' strings, the strings represented by
<code>ScriptVariable</code> objects can be concatenaded with
<code>operator+</code>.  The index operator (<code>operator[]</code>) is
also available, allowing to access chars of the string in an obvious way.
The <code>operator+=</code> is available for <code>char</code>s and
C&nbsp;strings (that is, <code>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</code>), as well as
for other <code>ScriptVariable</code> objects.
</p>
<p><strong>Objects of the class have strictly the size of a single
pointer</strong>, which allows to pass them by value, return them from
functions, assign them here and there, with no harm to efficiency.  Unlike
the ``modern'' versions of <code>std::string</code>, <strong>the
<code>ScriptVariable</code> class implements the copy-on-write
strategy</strong> and will always do.  Yes, this is principially
incompatible with multithreading, and that's good: be good and never ever
use multithreading in your programs, because only bad and evil people do
so.
</p>
<p>Another feature worth mentioning is that a <code>ScriptVariable</code>
class object is capable to be <em>invalid</em>.  It can be constructed in
the invalid state by passing <code>(char*)0</code> value to the converting
constructor, and there's a special (tiny) derived class named
<code>ScriptVariableInv</code> which is created in the invalid state by its
default constructor.  An object can also be <em>invalidated</em> by calling
the <code>Invalidate()</code> method, and can be made valid again by
assigning a valid string to it.  An object can be queried for its validity
by methods <code>IsValid()</code> and <code>IsInvalid()</code>.
</p>
<p>There's a slave class <code>ScriptVariable::Substring</code>, which
represents a <em>substring</em> of a given string.  The object is created
in several cases, the most important of them is an explicit call to the
<code>Range(<em>index</em>,&nbsp;<em>length</em>)</code> method.  The range
selected this way can then be erased or replaced with another string, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
      str.Range(0, 5).Erase();
      str.Range(7, -1).Replace("foobar");
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>(well, passing <code>-1</code> as the length means &ldquo;all the
rest&rdquo;).  These <code>Erase()</code> and
<code>Replace(<em>string</em>)</code> are methods of the
<code>ScriptVariable::Substring</code>, which is the return type for the
<code>Range</code> method.
</p>
<p>It is useful to remember that the substring's method <code>Get()</code>
makes a copy of the selected substring and returns it as a new
<code>ScriptVariable</code> object.
</p>
<p>Another important feature of the <code>ScriptVariable</code> class is to
convert a string representing a number to the represented numeric value.
Here are the four methods for this:
</p>
<pre>
    bool GetLong(long &amp;l, int radix = 0) const;
    bool GetLongLong(long long &amp;l, int radix = 0) const;
    bool GetDouble(double &amp;d) const;
    bool GetRational(long &amp;p, long &amp;q) const;
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>All methods return <code>true</code> in case the conversion is successful,
otherwise they return <code>false</code> and leave the arguments untouched.
</p>
<p>Please be <strong>warned</strong> that the zero value for radix, which is
the default, means to convert like in the C language, that is,
<code>"0x25"</code> will get converted as hexadecimal (so the decimal value
will be 37), and <code>"025"</code> will be considered octal (decimal 21).
In most cases the thing you really want is achieved specifying
<code>10</code> as the radix value for these <code>GetLong</code> and
<code>GetLongLong</code>.
</p>
<p>The opposite conversion &mdash; from numbers to strings &mdash; is done by
the <code>ScriptNumber</code> class, which is a direct descendent of
<code>ScriptVariable</code>.  It has converting constructors for all
existing base numeric types.
</p>




<h2 id="scriptvector"><code>ScriptVector</code> class and string tokenization<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <code>ScriptVector</code> class generally represents a (resizeable)
vector of <code>ScriptVariable</code> objects.  However, its main indended
use is not to store these objects, but rather to <em>break a given string
down to words or tokens</em>, which is performed by its constructors.
A&nbsp;vector of strings is perhaps the most natural representation for a
result of such operations, hence the class.
</p>
<p>To get the <code>ScriptVector</code> class available, one must
<code>#include &lt;scriptpp/scrvect.hpp&gt;</code> header file.
</p>
<p>It is important to understand the difference between words and tokens, in
terms used in the scriptpp library.  Generally, <em>words</em> in a string
can be separated by any non-zero amount of whitespace chars (or any other
chars choosen to be used as separators), and hence words can't be empty,
while <em>tokens</em> are expected to be separated by exactly one delimiter
between them, and in case there are more than one delimiter, it is assumed
there are empty tokens between the delimiters.  For example, if we for some
reason decide to use the &ldquo;<code>#</code>&rdquo; char as the only
separator/delimiter, then the string <code>"#abra###cadabra#"</code> will
break down to <em>two words</em> <code>"abra"</code> and
<code>"cadabra"</code>, but to <em>six tokens</em>: <code>""</code>,
<code>"abra"</code>, <code>""</code>, <code>""</code>,
<code>"cadabra"</code>, <code>""</code>.
</p>
<p>Tokens (in the given sense), by their nature, can be optionally trimmed off
the leading and trailing whitespace (or whatever chars we decide to trim
off as if they were whitespace).  Words, by contrast, should not need any
trimming, we just tell the tokenizer to consider all unwanted chars as
being separators.  This allows to use a (kinda non-intuitive) rule: if we
specify the string, the set of delimiter chars <strong>and</strong> the set
of whitespace chars to be trimmed off (even empty), then we are requesting
tokens, but if we only specify the string and the separator (whitespace)
chars, then we are asking for words.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
      ScriptVariable s("#abra###cadabra#");
      ScriptVector v1(s, "#");
      ScriptVector v2(s, "#", " \t\r\n");
      ScriptVector v3(s, "#", "");
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Once constructed this way, <code>v1</code> will contain the two words, and
both <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code> will (each) hold the six tokens.
</p>
<p>The default constructor creates an empty vector (that is, a vector of zero
length); there's <code>operator[]</code>, which gives access to the
elements of the vector (and the vector authomatically resize in case the
index is out of range).  Some other important methods are
<code>Length()</code>, which returns the current amount of elements in the
vector, and <code>AddItem(<em>string</em>)</code>, which adds another
string to the vector's end (well... like <code>push_back</code> in STL).
</p>
<p>For more methods, take a look at the header file.
</p>



<h2 id="macros">Macroprocessor<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <a href="macro_intro.html">macroprocessor</a> is implemented by the
<code>ScriptMacroprocessor</code> class, <code>#include
&lt;scriptpp/scrmacro.hpp&gt;</code> to access it.  In the header file
there's a relatively long commentary describing the class.
</p>
<p>From the user's point of view the macroprocessor is explained on the
<a href="macro_intro.html">Macroprocessor introduction</a> page.  Be sure
to read it before going further.
</p>
<p>The class allows to redefine the escape char as well as all the special
chars used by the macroprocessor, but this possibility is not used in
Thalassa; we use the defaults for all the five chars <code>%[]{}</code>.
</p>
<p>Being constructed by default, the macroprocessor class contains no macros;
the macros are expected to be added by the user (the module or program
which uses the macroprocessor).  There's an abstract class named
<span id="macro_class"></span>
<code>ScriptMacroprocessorMacro</code> intended to represent the notion of
a generic macro with a name; all macros are implemented by its subclasses.
</p>
<p>The macroexpansion is supposed to be done by the <code>Expand</code>
methods; there are two of them, one accepts a <code>ScriptVector</code>
containing arguments, and the other accepts no arguments.  The version
that accepts the vector of parameters is pure virtual in the base class,
while the no-args version has a default implementation which creates an
empty <code>ScriptVector</code> object and calls the other version of the
method.  This version can be overriden, too, to gain efficiency for macros
that don't accept arguments.
</p>
<p>The library provides several convenient predefined subclasses of the
<code>ScriptMacroprocessorMacro</code> class.  We'll describe some of them.
</p>
<p>The (abstract) <code>ScriptMacroVariable</code> implements the generic
notion of a macro accepting no arguments.  It introduces the pure virtual
method <code>Text()</code> which is supposed to return the string to which
the macro is to be expanded.
</p>
<p>Two heavily used classes are derived from <code>ScriptMacroVariable</code>:
the <code>ScriptMacroConst</code> class implements a macro which always
expand to the same string, passed to the object as its constructor
argument, and the <code>ScriptMacroScrVar</code> class represents a macro
that expands to the current value of a <code>ScriptVariable</code> object,
which itself exists somewhere else and whose <em>address</em> is given to
the <code>ScriptMacroScrVar</code> class as its constructor argument.
</p>
<p>A slightly more complicated thing is implemented by the
<code>ScriptMacroDictionary</code> class.  The macro implemented with this
class accepts exactly one argument, which is a dictionary key; the call
expands to the value associated with the key.  The dictionary is
represented by a <code>ScriptVector</code> of even length, the 0th, 2nd,
4th... items being the keys, and the 1st, 3rd, 5th... representing values
to expand to.  The object can either make a copy of your vector, or (if you
wish so) assume the vector remains existing somewhere else, and there's no
need for a copy.
</p>
<p>For anything not covered with these classes, one has to derive his/her own
class from the abstract <code>ScriptMacroprocessorMacro</code> class,
overriding the <code>Expand</code> method as appropriate.
</p>
<p>All these objects representing macros are to be passed to the
macroprocessor object using the <code>AddMacro</code> method.  Please note
the class assumes <em>ownership</em> over all these objects, so they
<strong>must</strong> be created in the dynamic memory (with operator
<code>new</code>); once passed to the macroprocessor, they start to belong
to it in the sense the macroprocessor actually <code>delete</code>s all
macro objects from its destructor.
