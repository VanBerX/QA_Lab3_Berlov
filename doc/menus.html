    <div class="page_body">
<p>Menu is effectively a list of web links, in which one item may be
<em>current</em> and therefore to be displayed differently, usually in
different color and without the active link.  In Thalassa, this is
achieved with so-called <em>labels</em>.  Each menu item has an associated
label, and the <em>current label</em> is passed as an argument to the macro
that builds the menu, so it can handle the item with the same label in a
way other than for all the other items.
</p>
<p>Menus are configured with ini file sections of the <code>menu</code> group,
headed like this:
</p>
<pre>
  [menu <em>NAME</em>]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>&mdash; where <em>NAME</em> is a distinct identifier you'll use to
reference the menu.  The menu itself is defined by the <code>items</code>
parameter's value.  The first non-whitespace char in the value is used as
the field delimiter; every menu item occupies four fields: the first
defines the menu item's text, the second is the link (as it will appear in
the <code>a&nbsp;href</code> attribute), the third is assumed to be the
value for the <code>title</code> attribute of the link (typically it is
displayed as a tooltip when the user points the mouse to the menu
item), and the last (fourth) is the label.  For example, your menu
definition might look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  [menu topmenu]
  items =
    | News      | /news.html     | The site's news feed | pg.news
    | Docs      | /docs.html     | Documentation        | pg.docs
    | Books     | /books.html    | Books on topic       | pg.books
    | Download  | /download.html | Files to download    | pg.download
    | FAQ       | /faq.html      | Frequently asked questions | pg.faq
    | Feedback  | /thalcgi.cgi/email
                   | Send a message to the site's owner | feedback
    | Guestbook | /guestbook     | The guestbook        | guestbook
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>For every field, all leading and trailing whitespace is stripped off.
</p>
<p>There are two special cases.  If the second field (the link) is left empty,
but the first (the item's text) is not empty, such item defines a
<em>tag</em>, that is, a piece of text inserted into the menu for
descriptive purposes.  Tag is not intended to be a link, to become a
current item etc., it is there for informational purposes only, not as a
navigation element.  If <em>both</em> the first and the second fields are
left empty, this means a <em>break</em>, which may appear as an additional
space between items, or as a rule between them, or the like.
</p>
<p>For tags and breaks, the third and fouth fields (the tooltip and the label)
are typically ignored and should be left empty (but make sure they actually
still there, meaning that exactly four field delimiter chars are there for
each item).  However, they are still passed to the macroprocessor just like
for link items, so in theory you can use them for your own purposes.
</p>

<p>Besides the <code>items</code> parameter, a <code>menu</code> ini section
should contain the following parameter:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>begin</code> &mdash; defines the HTML code snippet that starts
the menu;</li>

<li><code>end</code> &mdash; defines the HTML code snippet that ends
the menu;</li>

<li><code>link</code> &mdash; template used to display menu items in their
normal (active) state;</li>

<li><code>curpos</code> &mdash; template used to display the current
(disabled) menu item;</li>

<li><code>tag</code> &mdash; template used to display tag items (the items
for which the link field is left empty;</li>

<li><code>break</code> &mdash; template used to form a break (empty space
or the like).</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Within the <code>link</code>, <code>curpos</code>, <code>tag</code> and
<code>break</code> parameters' values,
positional macros are available to access properties of the menu item being
processed: <code>%0%</code> expands to the item's text, <code>%1%</code>
expands to the link, and <code>%2%</code> expands to the title text.
</p>
<p class="remark">The <code>%3%</code> macro call expands to the label
field just as you could expect, but you shouldn't need this; if you think
you do, perhaps you're doing something wrong.<p></p>
</p>
<p>For example, your menu can be configured as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  begin = &lt;ul class="menu"&gt;
  end = &lt;/ul&gt;
  link = &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="%1%" %[if:%2%:title=%[q:%2%]:]
                class="menu_link"&gt;%0%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  curpos = &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="menu_curr"&gt;%0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  tag = &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="menu_tag"&gt;%0%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  break =
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>In this example, break items, if any, will have no effect; actually we
can't have breaks within <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> correctly.  This is though
not the only possible approach to menu rendering, and if you use something
different, like a sequence of paragraphs, or of strings enclosed in smth.
like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, or even of table cells, there are lots of
ways to implement a break there.
</p>
<p>Refer to various CSS manuals on how to define these <code>menu</code>,
<code>menu_link</code> and <code>menu_curr</code> classes properly.
</p>
<p>Menus are inserted into your pages by calling the <code>menu</code> macro,
which accepts two arguments: the menu ID and the label.  If the page you
compose doesn't correspond to any of the menu items, the second argument
should be left blank.
</p>
<p>For the example above, it is natural to assume that pages
<code>news.html</code>,
<code>docs.html</code>,
<code>books.html</code>,
<code>download.html</code> and
<code>faq.html</code>
are generated as page set items, with <code>pg</code> being the set ID and
<code>news</code>,
<code>docs</code>,
<code>books</code>,
<code>download</code> and
<code>faq</code> being the item IDs; at the same time, the pages
corresponding to the feedback form and to the guestbook are created in some
other manner.  In this setting, the macro call within the <code>pg</code>'s
page template might look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  %[menu:topmenu:pg.%[li:id]]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>If we suppose that the guestbook page is created as a list item page
(please note it can't be a stand-alone page because stand-alone pages can't
have comment sections, which is obviously needed for the guestbook), in its
template the macro should be called as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  %[menu:topmenu:guestbook]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p class="remark">The &ldquo;Feedback&rdquo; page in our example looks like a page
provided by the CGI part of Thalassa.  Displaying menus from the main
configuration on such a page is tricky, it requires to generate the CGI
program configuration file as a &ldquo;stand-alone page&rdquo;.  We won't discuss it
here.<p></p>
