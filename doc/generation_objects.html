<h2 id="baselevel">Generated files, existing files and aliases<p></h2>
</p>
<p>A web site generated with Thalassa CMS is almost entirely static (it can
even be fully static if you don't use interactive features), and a static
web site is essentially a directory tree with files.  Some of these files
are text, primarily the web pages themselves, represented with HTML; but
your site can contain (and serve upon requests via the HTTP(S) protocol)
binary files as well, and most of existing sites contain at least images
(photos, pictograms and the like) represented as binaries.
</p>
<p>The <code>thalassa</code> program can basically do three kind of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>generate text files (containing anything you want, not only HTML);</li>
<li>publish existing files verbatim, as they are &mdash; that is, copy
existing files into you web site's tree, or link them instead of copying,
or make symlinks to them; both binary and text files can be published,
essential here is that they must already exist somewhere,
<code>thalassa</code> only makes them available within the web tree;</li>
<li>make symlinks inside your web site's tree, thus creating kind of
&ldquo;aliases&rdquo;.</li>
<p></ul>
</p>
<p>For publishing existing files, not too many variants exist: you can instruct
<code>thalassa</code> to publish a single file (this is called
<code>binary</code>, but certainly you can publish a text file this way as
well) or to publish an entire directory (a <code>collection</code>).  For a
&ldquo;collection&rdquo;, you can choose to publish subdirectories recursively or to
ignore them, to follow symlinks, ignore symlinks or make exactly the same
symlinks, to ignore &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; files (that is, files with names starting
with a dot &ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo;) or to publish them as well.  Actually, it
doesn't seem a lot of other things can be invented for the purpose of
<a href="verbatim_publishing.html">verbatim publishing</a> (use the link to
learn more).
</p>
<p>For text files' generation, there are a lot of different features, and it's
clear why: actually, that's what <code>thalassa</code> is made for.
</p>


<h2 id="pages">Stand-alone HTML pages and other text files<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The simplest thing you can do is just to generate a single stand-alone HTML
page, or even an arbitrary text file.  BTW, we actively &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; this
feature to generate these <code>.htaccess</code> files for Apache;
sometimes we even generate configuration files for the
<code>thalcgi.cgi</code> program.  Also it is relatively easy to make an
RSS feed (which is technically just an XML file) with what Thalassa is
capable of, and the stand-alone page facility fits this need the best.
</p>
<p>A page (or, generally, a file) to
generate may be entirely defined by a single <code>[page]</code> section in
<a href="ini_basics">ini files</a>, or you can create a
<code>[template]</code> section and then let several <code>[page]</code>
sections use it.  The detailed description is found on the page devoted to
<a href="simple_pages.html">creating simple pages</a>.
</p>
<p>Besides that, <code>thalassa</code> features generation of arbitrary text
files outside of your web tree.  This may be useful, e.g., to create
configuration files for some third-party software, using options and other
values defined in your ini files written for <code>thalassa</code>.
This feature is called <em>genfile</em> (for <em>generic file</em>), and is
configured with a <code>[genfile]</code> section.  See the
<a href="generic_files.html">generic files</a> page for the description.
</p>


<h2 id="pagesets">Page sets<p></h2>
</p>
<p>A more advanced approach to HTML pages generation is so called
<a href="page_sets.html">page sets</a>.  In your source tree, a page set is
essentially a directory containing one <em>object</em> per each page you
want to generate; the object may be either a text file in the <a href="headed_text.html">headed text format</a>, or a directory containing
such a file (in this case, additional files, like images, may be added).
Within ini files, a set is defined by a <code>[pageset]</code> section; to
add more pages, you just place more files or directories into the set
source directory, and on the next run of the generator they all become
pages of your site.
</p>
<p>It is useful to remember that sets as such are unordered.  From the other
hand, a set can serve as a source for a so-called <em>list</em>, or even
for several lists.
</p>


<h2 id="lists">Lists<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <a href="lists.html">lists</a> are perhaps the hardest-to-explain
concept behind Thalassa, but they are extremely useful and, surprisingly,
are in fact quite easy to use, once you understood what they are.
</p>
<p>To start the explanation, let's say that a list is, well, a list &mdash; an
ordered list of items.  Every item may (but not necessarily do) correspond
to a page to be generated; if this is the case, adding another item to your
list causes <code>thalassa</code> to generate one more HTML file, called
<em>list item page</em> (not to be confused with <em>list pages</em>).  The
<em>list item</em> itself (in contrary to the item page) is (intended to
be) a relatively small piece of text, usually HTML.
</p>
<p>List items (again, not to be confused with list item pages) can be put
together in either direct or reverse order, thus forming, well, the list as
such.  You can choose to generate a single <span id="list_pages">list
page</span> (and once again, not
to be confused with list item pages), or an array of list pages, having
your choosen amount of items per page.  Furthermore, you can mark the list
as <em id="embedded_lists">embedded</em>; in this case no list pages will
be generated at all, and the list itself will be available wherever you
want via a macro call.
</p>
<p>If you need to understand better what is this all about, imagine a classic
blog (not a microblog, it's important) or a news line.  Every
<em>item</em>, be it a blog entry or a news article, is represented both as
its own page and as a short summary made for inclusion in various lists so
that people can take a look and find the items interesting for them.  These
lists often tend to grow rapidly so a clear need arises to break the single
very long list down to pages, showing a certain amount (say, 20 or the
like) items per page.  Such a blog or a news line is exactly what Thalassa
lists are designed for (but they can be used for other purposes as well).
</p>
<p>A list is defined by a <code>[list&nbsp;]</code> section in the ini files, but
this is only the very beginning of the story, because such a section only
defines the list as a whole object, and one needs some way to define the
<em>items</em> as well.  In the present version, there are two
possibilities.
</p>
<p>First, you can introduce your own
<a href="ini_basics.html#sectiongroups">section group</a> in your ini
files for this purpose; for example, if you want to create a blog, the word
<code>blog</code> may serve as a good name for such a section group, so
individual entries in your blog will be defined by sections whose headers
have the form <code>[blog&nbsp;<em>ENTRY_ID</em>]</code>, like
<code>[blog&nbsp;20230207_my_birthday]</code>,
<code>[blog&nbsp;20230401_fools]</code> etc; well, actually you can have
any IDs you want, and they will turn into file names, like
<code>20230207_my_birthday.html</code>, <code>20230401_fools.html</code>
and so on.
</p>
<p>The second possibility is that you can use an existing <a href="#pagesets">page set</a>, or any subset of it, as the source for your
list; actually one page set can serve as a source for several different
lists.  Page sets are by their nature unordered, so using them as list
sources involves additional files that explicitly enumerate page set items
to be included into a particular list, in the order they should appear in
the list.
</p>
<p>Besides the main intended use (for blogs, news lines and other similar things),
lists can be conveniently used for some other purposes.  For instance, if you
need to create some similar pages, but don't want to have a separate file
for each of them (or, may be, you just want to use <a href="macro_intro.html">Thalassa macroprocessor</a> in their source texts,
which is impossible within <a href="headed_text">headed text files</a> used
for page sets), you can use for this purpose a list with ini file sections
as its source.  List item pages will serve your need, while the list itself
in this case is most probably unneeded.  To suppress generation of the list
pages (you don't confuse them with list item pages, do you?), the list may
be declared &ldquo;embedded&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>In contrast, lists that use page sets as their item sources usually don't
have item pages, because pages are in fact already there &mdash; they get
generated as pages of the page set.  So, likely for such a list you'll need
only the list itself, not item pages.  However, Thalassa list facility allows
even this: you can instruct it to generate for your list its own item
pages, which may look different from those generated for the set.
</p>
<p>One more interesting thing about lists is that a single source can serve
more than one lists.  For example, if you have a news line on your site,
but it has its own page, not the main page of your site, then you might
want to have something like &ldquo;last news&rdquo; list on the main page.  This can
be done easily just by creating another list on the same source as your
news.  And one more list for the same source can be used to generate an RSS
feed (which is technically just an XML file) for your news.
</p>
<p>As usual, see the <a href="lists.html">page devoted to lists</a> for more
information.
</p>


<h2 id="aliases">Aliases<p></h2>
</p>
<p class="remark">If you don't need these bloody aliases, you can easily
<a href="#end_of_aliases">skip this section</a>.  This must be true if you
are going to create a new site from scratch; we strongly recommend not to
involve any aliases until you absolutely have to.<p></p>
</p>
<p>Aliases are used when a single HTML page (or other object served via
HTTP(S) from your site) for any reason should be accessible with more than
one local URI.  For example, suppose you have a real (that is, existing)
file named <code>foo/drink/drive.html</code> within your web tree, so it
has a full URL like <code>http://www.example.com/foo/drink/drive.html</code>,
and (for any reason we don't want to know) you want it also to be
accessible as <code>foo/smoke/fly.html</code>, which means the full URL
<code>http://www.example.com/foo/smoke/fly.html</code> should return the
same content.
</p>
<p>For a static site there are basically two approaches to achieve this.  The
simpler one is just to create <code>foo/smoke</code> directory and put
there the appropriate symbolic link, which for this example would be named
<code>fly.html</code> and must point to <code>../drink/drive.html</code>.
</p>
<p>This is exactly what <a href="aliases.html">Thalassa CMS aliases</a> do.
Objects configured for this purpose are known as &ldquo;alias groups&rdquo;; you can
have several of them, although more than one is rarely needed.  An alias
group is defined by an <code>[aliases <em>ID</em>]</code> section in your
ini files.  In the simplest case, such a section will have just one
parameter, which is also named <code>aliases</code> and contains a list of
pairs &lt;alias&nbsp;+&nbsp;original&gt;.  For every pair, Thalassa will
compute the shortest possible symbolic link and create it.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes this is not sufficient to do what you need,
specially when you're moving an existing and well-established site from a
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; CMS like Drupal or Joomla, and want to keep all your URIs
working so that no links on third party sites get broken.  Such sites are
usually served in a fully-dynamic manner, which effectively means you don't
have any real files nor directories there, hence your visible URIs are not
bound by any filesystem-related reality.  When there are no bounds, the
so-called &ldquo;webmasters&rdquo; often create URI trees very difficult to reproduce
with a filesystem path tree.
</p>
<p>Suppose you need <code>foo/smoke/fly.html</code> to point to one (real)
document, and <code>foo/smoke</code> to point to another one.
</p>
<p>Well, <strong>do your best to avoid such nonsense as long as you
can</strong>.
</p>
<p>However, if you really have no other choice, then the second approach to
aliases has to be involved, and it is to instruct your HTTP server (e.g.
Apache) to do some alchemy on URIs before actually serving the request.
</p>
<p>It is possible to put an <code>.htaccess</code> file into your web root
directory and place there as many <code>RewriteRule</code>s as you need to
fully match what is needed.  Well, you can even generate this
<code>.htaccess</code> file as a <a href="#pages">stand-alone page</a>, but
Thalassa will not help you to generate the appropriate &ldquo;rules&rdquo;, you'll
have to do it on your own.  But you can end up with such an amount of
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; that you'll have to decide this is not the way to go.
</p>
<p>What Thalassa can actually help is to try hybrid approach, using symbolic
links as mush as possible and only leaving unresolvable cases to your HTTP
server.  In the example above, you can still add two pairs to your list of
aliases:
</p>
<pre>
    foo/smoke/fly.html:foo/drink/drive.html
    foo/smoke:foo/bur/buzz.html
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>&mdash; but, knowing perfectly this can't work, you can <em>in the same
<code>[aliases&nbsp;]</code> section</em> specify explicitly that
<code>foo/smoke</code> contains other links and hence has to be a real
directory, not a symbolic link.  After that you can also instruct Thalassa to
generate a file inside each of such directories, set the name for the file,
and specify a template for its content, where a local macro will be
substituted with the target URI (taken from the list).  Most probably the
name will be <code>.htaccess</code>, and the file will contain the
appropriate redirect directive.
</p>
<p>Detailed instructions are found at the <a href="aliases.html">page devoted
to aliases</a>.  If you really need them, well, we wish you good luck.

</p>



<h2 id="additionals">Additional objects<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Additional objects are something which is not generated as separate files
within your site's tree; instead, they are certain pieces of HTML code
inserted here and there in your generated files.
</p>
<p>Of what we have discussed already, <a href="#embedded_lists">embedded
lists</a> make a good example of additional objects.  Besides that,
Thalassa supports <a href="blocks.html">blocks</a>, <a href="menus.html">menus</a>, <a href="index_bars.html">index
bars</a> and <a href="comment_sections.html">user comment sections</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Block</strong> is simply an HTML code snippet; it doesn't even have
to look like a &ldquo;block&rdquo;; in most cases it does, but generally it may be
anything you want.  Every block belongs to a <em>block group</em>, and each
block group is a thing accessible via a macro call.  The idea behind a
block group is to represent something you want to appear on all (or many)
of your pages, like a side panel, bottom or even something within or near
the header of every page.  Each block may have an associated <em>tag</em>,
and the macro which generates a block group accepts an additional argument,
allowing to pass a list of tags; a particular block will appear on the
particular page (within the group) either if the block has no tag (which
effectively means &ldquo;show me everywhere&rdquo;), or its tag is found in the set
passed to the macro, or among the tags the page itself has.  See the
<a href="blocks.html">blocks and block groups page</a> for more info.
</p>
<p><strong>Menu</strong> is effectively a list of links you want to appear in
more than one place of your site (up to the case of every page).  This
could be achieved by already existing instruments, e.g., embedded lists,
blocks or even simply <a href="general_configuration.html#html_macro">html
snippets</a>, but there's one property specific for menus: if a menu
is displayed on a page to which one of its items points, that particular
item should be displayed differently (e.g., &ldquo;disabled&rdquo;).  Menus provided
by Thalassa involve associating a label with every menu item, and the
macro, which generates the menu, also accepts a label as its argument; if
the label matches, the corresponding menu item is displayed using
alternative template.  More information, including detailed instructions,
is provided at <a href="menus.html">the page devoted to menus</a>.
</p>
<p><strong id="index_bars">Index bars</strong> are used for
<em>arrays of pages</em>, which means there are several automatically
generated pages, ordered and, more importantly, <em>numbered</em>.  In the
present version of Thalassa, there are exactly two cases of such
arrays:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#list_pages">list pages</a> (not to be confused with
list item pages) for lists that don't fit on a single page;</li>
<li>copies of a single page (either list item one, or a page set item)
generated to display a large amount of user comments in a distributed
manner.</li>
<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Appearance of index bars is configurable, and the result if available
by calling a macro.  For details, see the <a href="index_bars.html">page
devoted to index bars</a>.
</p>
<p>The last type of an &ldquo;additional object&rdquo; is a <strong id="comment_sections">user comment section</strong>.  Only
list item pages and page set items may have comments; stand-alone pages in
the present version of Thalassa are not suitable for publishing comments.
In contrast with all the other types of additional objects, comment
sections are not available through macro calls; instead, templates for
pages suitable for comments are broken down to two parts, first for the
page itself, and the second for the &ldquo;page tail&rdquo;; the comment section,
if it exists, is placed between the page segments expanded from those template
parts.  Additional pages (with the same content, but containing other
portions of the comments) are generated automatically, as appropriate.
</p>
<p>Comments are configured by comment style ini file sections; <a href="#lists">page lists</a> and <a href="#pagesets">page sets</a> support
configurable parameters to reference one of the existing configured styles
and to set some additional options.  Detailed description is on the
<a href="comment_sections.html">page devoted to comment sections</a>.
