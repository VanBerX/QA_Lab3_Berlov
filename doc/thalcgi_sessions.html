<h2 id="what_is_session">What is a work session, actually?<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Originally, HTTP is request-based, which means that client (browser)
establishes a connection with server, sends exaclty one request, receives
the server's response and closes the connection.  Recent implementations of
both browsers and servers are able to keep the connection to save some
traffic in case several requests from the same client to the same server
are needed in a row, which is a typical situation as a page can contain
images, and downloading each of them takes another request.  However, even
if several requests are performed using one TCP session, each of them is
still considered kinda self-containing, that is, from the server's point of
view, single requests have no relationship between them.
</p>
<p>From the user's point of view, the picture is very different.  Web sites
tend to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; what the user did, and even if they don't, it is a
rare case when the user fills a single web form and gets what (s)he wants
right from a single request.  More usual situation is when the site offers
the user several steps of a dialog.
</p>
<p class="remark">Well, the most common situation nowadays is that the
page containing the form changes right under the user's hands, and often it
does so despite the user didn't request anything like that.  Okay, all this
is done with client-side scripting, which we not only don't use, actually
we believe that publishing sites with client-side scripts should be
considered criminal and pusnished with several years in prison.<p></p>
</p>
<p>What's even more important is that sometimes users somehow identify
theirselves to a site, and all subsequent actions are assumed to be done by
the same user.  Also there are other <em>good</em> reasons (in contrast
with bad reasons, like tracking) for a site to remember something about the
user, like, as it is true for Thalassa, in case the user solved a CAPTCHA
test once, it looks fair not to force the user to do it again and again.
</p>
<p>So, it is obvious that web sites sometimes need to identify requests coming
from the same user, or, to say it another way, to separate requests coming
from different users.  Such requests, known to come from the same client,
are exactly what &ldquo;work session&rdquo; actually is.  There are two ways to
maintain sessions: the site needs either to use a cookie to store the
session ID, or to embed the ID into the URL of each page.
</p>
<p>The solution with session ID within the URL has several fundamental flows.
First, users tend to share URLs of what they see, and an average user will
not bother stripping off any session IDs from what (s)he copy/pastes to
another messenger to send to a friend.  The server may get confused seeing
the same session continuing from two different locations, and, what's more
serious, the &ldquo;friend&rdquo; who received the URL containing the session ID, may
do some actions on behalf of the user who sent the URL (and the one who
sent will hardly realize that (s)he shared not only the URL but also the
unintended &ldquo;procuracy&rdquo;).
</p>
<p>Another fundamental flow of keepig session ID in the URL is that it simply
doesn't work for static HTML pages.  Unlike various dynamically generated
content, static pages are, well, static.  They can &ldquo;accept&rdquo; (and ignore)
query parameters in an URL, but once the user follows a link from a static
page, that link obviously won't contain these query parameters, so the
session ID, if any, will be lost.  This is not a problem for these
&ldquo;modern&rdquo; sites that hardly contain a single static page, but for sites
made with Thalassa, which consist primarily of static pages (generated
beforehand, <strong>not</strong> when a request is received), this makes
URL-based session control effectively impossible.
</p>
<p>So, the only thing left to us is a cookie.  When a web-server sends a
reponse to its client, it can add one or more <em>cookies</em> to the
headers of the response.  A cookie is effectively a pair of strings, first
is the name, and the second is the value of the cookie.  Sending another
request to the same web site, the client (unless it is instructed otherwise
by the user) adds to the request's header all cookies earlier set by this
site.  Actually, cookies are <em>intended</em> to make longer sessions out
of otherwise-isolated requests.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, cookies often trigger some paranoia, and it has its reasons,
as cookies can also be used for tracking and other bad things.  It remains
unclear though why all these people afraid of cookies but don't give a damn
to JavaScript which is deadly dangerous, much much more dangerous and
harmful than cookies.  Anyway, there's no other option.  At least Thalassa
only sets a cookie when explicitly requested to do so by the user.
</p>


<h2 id="session_in_thalassa">Work sessions in Thalassa<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <code>thalassa</code> program itself is a static content generator, so
obviously neither the program itself, nor the content it generates, need
any sessions.  Hence, whenever we talk about work sessions in Thalassa, it
must be clear that we only mean the CGI program, <code>thalcgi.cgi</code>.
</p>
<p>The CGI program can do some things without a session, too.  The session
must be already established for any <code>POST</code> request, if only it
is not the request that actually establishes a new session.
A&nbsp;<code>GET</code> request will proceed normally without a session
unless the respective virtual page
<a href="thalcgi_pages.html#page_type_params">is configured to require a
session</a>.  In case the <code>session_required</code> parameter is set to
<code>yes</code> for the requested page, the CGI program will not send the
page to the user; instead, it will send a
<a href="thalcgi_baseconf.html#special_pages">special page</a> configured
with the <code>[nocookiepage]</code> section.
</p>
<p>The intention here is to display a webform on a page, and direct to the
same URL the <code>POST</code> request that contains the data which the
user entered into the form.  In such configuration it makes sense to only
display the form when the session is already established, otherwise a user
may waste some time filling the form just to get a &ldquo;no session&rdquo; error
right after pressing the submit button.  Furthermore, it is an intended (by
design) scenario when a user follows a link that points to a webform, gets
the <code>[nocookiepage]</code> special page instead of the form, reads
the text about the cookie, decides to set the cookie (and establish the
session), does so by solving the CAPTCHA test, and finally gets to the
desired webform because all this time the user stayed at the same virtual
location (that is, the URL in the browser's address line didn't change).
</p>
<p>Establising a session requires to solve the CAPTCHA test; in the present
version the CAPTCHA can't be disabled, and it's unlikely such an option
will appear in the future.  This is because technically every session is a
file within the <a href="thalcgi_overview.html#database">user database</a>
directory, so there's an obvious risk of a DoS attack; the CAPTCHA test
reduces this risk, because the session is actually created after the test
is successfully passed.
</p>
<p>The good news for users is that, at least in the present version,
establishing the working session is the only situation when the CAPTCHA is
to be solved.  Once the session is active, the user is assumed to be the
same (human).
</p>
<p>As we mentioned already, the <code>[nocookiepage]</code> is a special page,
which means it has no dedicated path (URI); to see it, a user with no
active session must point the browser to any of the pages configured to
require a session.  After that, if everything is configured properly, the
user receives the special page (with a CAPTCHA form), solves the CAPTCHA,
submits the solution, optionally (in case either the solution is not
correct, or something else went wrong) gets the
<code>[retrycaptchapage]</code>, which contains an explanation of what went
wrong and another CAPTCHA picture, finally submits the correct solution,
and after that receives <em>the page (s)he initially requested</em>, as the
URL didn't change.  But there's one thing to mention here: this is
<strong>the</strong> moment when the session actually starts to exist, and
together with the initially requested page, the user receives the cookie
that contains the session ID.
</p>


<h2 id="implementation">How sessions are implemented<p></h2>
</p>
<p>From the client's point of view, things look very simple: there's exactly
one cookie, named <code>thalassa_sessid</code> (the name is hardcoded in
the present version, which is likely to change).  The cookie has a value
that looks somewhat like <code>PJBKANFHFJGBNJNM_PPIGKEIGKBOFHDKL</code>,
and some attentive users may even notice that the first part of the value
(the chars before the underscore) remains the same, while the second part
(after the underscore) changes every time when another page served by the
CGI is loaded by the browser.
</p>
<p>Let's now explain something.  First of all, if for any reason you get
confused by these characters: these latin letters are actually hexadecimal
digits, but instead of the traditional <code>0..9,A..F</code>, just the
first 16 letters from the Latin alphabet (<code>A..P</code>) are used,
<code>A</code> for zero, <code>P</code> for 15.  Well, actually this
doesn't really matter, it is only the way choosen for Thalassa CMS to
generate random identifier strings: first, the desired amount of random
bytes is acquired, and then these bytes are translated, each to two
letters, as we've just explained.  Thalassa doesn't use the fact these
letters are hex digits, e.g., it never converts them back to numbers, they
are just random strings of a certain length, that's all.
</p>
<p>What's more important is that the <em>real</em> session identifier is the
part of the cookie's value which doesn't change &mdash; that part of the
string which is before the underscore (<code>PJBKANFHFJGBNJNM</code> in our
example).  The part <em>after</em> the underscore is a so-called
<em>token</em>; Thalassa uses it for an additional check against session
identifier interception.
</p>
<p>The active sessions are stored in the subdirectory named
<code>_sessions</code> under the
<a href="thalcgi_overview.html#database">user database</a> directory, where
exactly one file is created for each session, and the session ID is used as
the file name.
</p>
<p class="remark">Don't worry much.  Before trying to access the file in
any way, the CGI program checks whether it is <em>acceptable</em>.  In the
present version, this acceptability means the name only consists of
uppercase latin letters, digits, the underscore char, and is exactly 16
chars long; so hardly it is possible to perform any injection here.<p></p>
</p>
<p>The <span id="session_file">session file</span> is a text file containing
several
<code><em>NAME</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>VALUE</em></code> pairs, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  token = PPIGKEIGKBOFHDKL
  oldtoken = ADHFMBOOBGDOIDMB
  created = 1674939409
  expire = 1675256475
<p></pre>
If the user logs in or at least tells his/her username without actually
logging in (e.g., when requesting new passwords), more pairs get added to
the session file, so it can look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  token = OMBBNIGHNPJKPOOF
  oldtoken = JGDGEIINIAPHKHAF
  created = 1674939409
  expire = 1675256475
  user = charlie
  logged_in = yes
  login_time = 1675038541
<p></pre>
Furthermore, if the site is configured to allow anonymous comments, the
user, while remaining not logged in and even nameless (in the sense of
login name), still may use some arbitrary string as his/her &ldquo;visible
name&rdquo; when posting a comment; this name is stored in the session file
as an additional name-val pair, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  realname = Johnny the Great
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>It is more or less clear that date/time is stored as a &ldquo;unix date&rdquo; value
here.  Expiration time is the last request time plus 72 hours, which is
hardcoded, too (yes. yes, it definitely will change in next versions).  The
<code>token</code> is well, the token, that is, the part of the cookie
value, to the right from the underscore &mdash; that part which changes.
And now the <code>oldtoken</code>: it's the previous value of the token.
How <em>exactly</em> Thalassa checks the token validity is as follows: if
the token from the cookie is equal either to the <code>token</code> or the
<code>oldtoken</code> field of the session file.  This allows the session
to remain active in case the script generated the content to be sent to the
client, but something gone wrong with the connection between the client and
the server (the CGI will never know about it).
</p>


<h2 id="captcha_conf">Configuring CAPTCHA infrastructure<p></h2>
</p>
   <h3 id="captcha_section">The base parameters<p></h3>
</p>
<p>The CAPTCHA implementation in Thalassa uses a simple
<a href="thalcgi_overview.html#captcha">cryptographic trick explained
here</a>, so the CGI doesn't need to store any information locally on the
server until the CAPTCHA test is actually passed.  What it
<strong>does</strong> need is an arbitrary but not easily guessable string
which is kept private (the <em>secret</em>).  If unsure, issue a command
like the following:
</p>
<pre>
  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=16 count=1 status=none | shasum -b
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>and use the sum as your secret.
</p>
<p>Besides the secret string, there's one more parameter to set for the
CAPTCHA subsystem: the timeout value.  The user can't change the time value
sent to the client inside the cookie response form, because otherwise the
MD5 hash will not match, so the CGI can check if it took too long for the
user to solve the captcha.
</p>
<p>Both the secret and the timeout are configured with the
<code>[captcha]</code> ini section, in which two parameters are recognized:
<code>secret</code> for the secret string and <code>expire</code> for the
timeout value, in seconds.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
  [captcha]
  secret = 11e61c749de5944b74770b2206c2bfd97472c9d3
  expire = 300
<p></pre>
The timeout in this example is 5 minutes (300 seconds).
</p>


   <h3 id="captcha_form">CAPTCHA solution form<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Suppose the user wants to establish a session, so (s)he solves the CAPTCHA
and submits the solution.  It is important to understant that the
Thalassa CGI program detects this situation by seeing the following
conditions are met at once:</p>
<ul id="cookie_set_request_cond">

<li>it is a <code>POST</code> request, with the
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> content type;</li>

<li>there's no active session (the cookie isn't set or doesn't correspond
to an existing session);</li>

<li>there's a &ldquo;form input value&rdquo; (intended to come from a hidden input)
named <code>command</code>, with the value <code>setcookie</code>.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p class="remark">It worth mentioning that actually the &ldquo;form input&rdquo;
named <code>command</code> is not used anywhere else in the Thalassa CGI's
work, and it is never used with any other value.  So the pair
<code>command=setcookie</code> should be considered a kind of magic word to
detect this (very special) type of request.<p></p>
</p>
<p>Besides the <code>command</code> input value, the following inputs are
expected <em>for a setcookie request</em>:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>captcha_ip</code> &mdash; the IP address of the client, in the
most traditional decimal notation, like <code>198.51.100.173</code>;</li>

<li><code>captcha_time</code> &mdash; the time when the CAPTCHA was issued,
in the form of a unix date represented as a decimal, like
<code>1685300179</code>;</li>

<li><code>captcha_nonce</code> &mdash; the randomly-generated single-use
number, also known as <em>nonce</em>, represented as a hexadecimal number,
like <code>C34A30B848CC2FC1</code>;</li>

<li><code>captcha_token</code> &mdash; the MD5 hash of the string built as
a concatenation (in some unspecified order) of the IP, time, the correct
CAPTCHA answer and the configured secret value; the hash is represented in
base64, not in hex as you might be used to;</li>

<li><code>captcha_response</code> &mdash; the response to the CAPTCHA
challenge entered by the user.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Of all these &ldquo;inputs&rdquo;, only the <code>captcha_response</code> is intended
to be a real input field for the user to fill.  All the others clearly
should be hidden inputs; indeed, hardly a user can fill any of them.
Instead, the CGI program must &ldquo;fill&rdquo; them when a CAPTCHA-containing page
is generated.  All pages Thalassa CGI outputs (with the exception for a
default error page) are derived from templates set in the configuration
file, and this is true for the CAPTCHA pages, too; so one needs some means
to access the respective values, as well as the CAPTCHA image.  And here the
<code>%[captcha:&nbsp;]</code> macro enters the game.
</p>
<p>The <code>%[captcha:&nbsp;]</code> macro has several functions; when it is
expanded for the first time during the particular run of the Thalassa CGI
program, no matter which of its functions is used, the macro generates a
brand new CAPTCHA challenge, the correct response for it, memorizes the
current time and the client's IP address; after that, all functions
of the macro simply return the memorized values.  The macro has five
functions:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>%[captcha:image]</code> &mdash; the CAPTCHA challenge image, as a
PNG picture, encoded with base64;</li>

<li><code>%[captcha:ip]</code> &mdash; the IP address of the client;</li>

<li><code>%[captcha:time]</code> &mdash; the unix time value;</li>

<li><code>%[captcha:nonce]</code> &mdash; the nonce value;</li>

<li><code>%[captcha:token]</code> &mdash; the MD5 hash to be the value for
the <code>captcha_token</code> form input.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>For the present version of Thalassa, a CAPTCHA form should appear on two
different pages, both
&ldquo;<a href="thalcgi_baseconf.html#special_pages">special</a>&rdquo;:
<code>[nocookiepage]</code> and <code>[retrycaptchapage]</code>.
The content of these pages is (well, should be) different, so it is
recommended to prepare the CAPTCHA response form as a snippet within the
<a href="thalcgi_baseconf.html#html_section"><code>[html]</code> ini
section</a>.  For example, the following may work:
</p>
<pre>
  [html]
  cookieform =
  +&lt;img alt="captcha" style="float:right;"
  +     src="data:image/jpg;base64,%[captcha:image]" /&gt;
  +&lt;form name="captcha" action="%[req:script]%[req:path]" method="POST"&gt;
  +&lt;input type="hidden" name="captcha_ip" value=%[q:%[captcha:ip]] /&gt;
  +&lt;input type="hidden" name="captcha_time" value=%[q:%[captcha:time]] /&gt;
  +&lt;input type="hidden" name="captcha_nonce" value=%[q:%[captcha:nonce]] /&gt;
  +&lt;input type="hidden" name="captcha_token" value=%[q:%[captcha:token]] /&gt;
  +&lt;label for="captcha_input"&gt;Please enter the string made by swapping
  + letters as shown at the picture to the right.  There are digits and
  + latin letters only, case is ignored:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  +&lt;input type="text" id="captcha_input" name="captcha_response" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
  +&lt;input type="hidden" name="command" value="setcookie" /&gt;
  +&lt;input type="submit" value="Set cookie and create session" /&gt;
  +&lt;/form&gt;
  +
<p></pre>
</p>

   <h3 id="no_cookie_page">The No Cookie special page<p></h3>
</p>
<p>The No Cookie special page is the content to be displayed to the user in
case the user requested a page which is configured as requiring an active
session, and there's no active session.
</p>
<p>The page is configured with a <code>[nocookiepage]</code> ini section which
is presently supposed to contain only one parameter, named
<code>template</code>.  The parameter's value is passwd through the
macroprocessor to build the actual HTML document to be sent to the user.
</p>
<p>Certainly the No Cookie page <strong>must</strong> contain the
<a href="#captcha_form">CAPTCHA solution form</a>.  The rest is generally
up to you, but perhaps the page <strong>should</strong> display a brief
text explaining what's going on, stating that we're going to set a cookie,
as well as that all the site's features &mdash; except for the interactive
&mdash; should work without cookies, and that the cookie can be removed
from the user's browser at any time.
</p>


   <h3 id="retry_captcha_page">The Retry Captcha special page<p></h3>
</p>
<p>The Retry Captcha special page is the content displayed to the user in case
the user just tried to solve the CAPTCHA (that is, submitted the CAPTCHA
form in a request that meets <a href="#cookie_set_request_cond">the
conditions</a> &mdash; BTW, this implies that the Retry Captcha page can
only be displayed in response to a <code>POST</code> request, which may be
important), but for any reason the solution is rejected.  Actually
there are five different reasons why it can be rejected, and it seems a
good idea to tell the user what went wrong.  So the
<code>[retrycaptchapage]</code> ini section, which configures the Retry
Captcha page, is a bit more complicated than for the two other special
pages.
</p>
<p>Just like other sections defining pages, this section has the
<code>template</code> parameter, whose value is passed through the
macroprocessor to build the content to send to the user; only for this
parameter's value there's an additional content-specific macro,
<code>%errmessage%</code>, which expands to a short piece of text
explaining what's the actual reason the CGI rejected the user's submission.
</p>
<p>The error messages themselves are configurable, too; for that, there's the
second parameter in the same section, named <code>errmessage</code>.  The
parameter <em>should</em> be set separately for each of the five predefined
<a href="ini_basics.html#parameter_specifiers">specifiers</a>, pretty
self-explanatory: <code>ip_mismatch</code>, <code>expired</code>,
<code>broken_data</code>, <code>wrong_answer</code> and
<code>unknown</code>.  Setting the values for this parameter, you can
choose your own wording and, e.g. translate the messages to a language
other that English; for English, the following may make you a good start:
</p>
<pre>
  [retrycaptchapage]
  errmessage:ip_mismatch = &lt;strong&gt;ip address mismatch&lt;/strong&gt;.
     It is possible you reconnected to the Internet between you
     received the captcha and submitted the answer.
  errmessage:expired = &lt;strong&gt;time is over&lt;/strong&gt; (5 minutes).
  errmessage:broken_data = &lt;strong&gt;broken data in the request&lt;/strong&gt;.
     The most likely it is a server side problem; if it repeats,
     please contact the site owner.
  errmessage:wrong_answer = &lt;strong&gt;wrong captcha answer&lt;/strong&gt;.
     Please try again.
  errmessage:unknown = &lt;strong&gt;unknown reason&lt;/strong&gt;.
     This must never happen in normal circumstances.  Please report
     this to the site administration.
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>For <code>errmessage:expired</code>, in case you set the
<code>[captcha]/expire</code> parameter to something different from
<code>300</code>, be sure to replace &ldquo;<code>5 munutes</code>&rdquo; with
whatever explains the expiration period you choose.
</p>
<p>Remember that the page <strong>must</strong> contain the
<a href="#captcha_form">CAPTCHA solution form</a>; the rest is up to you,
even explanations are not necessary as the user can only endup seeing this
page <em>after</em> reading the <a href="#no_cookie_page">No Cookie</a>
page.
</p>


<h2 id="sess_macro">The <code>%[sess:&nbsp;]</code> macro<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The session status (including absense of a session), as well as all data
associated with the session in case it exists, can be examined with the
<code>%[sess:&nbsp;]</code> macro.  When the session is associated with a
user account (whether logged in or unverified), the macro provides access
to the user account's properties as well.  Furthermore, the same macro is
used to access the moderation queue.
</p>
<p>As usual, the macro accepts at least one argument which must be the
function name, and for some functions it accepts more arguments.  We'll be
documenting the <code>sess</code> macro functions along with the features
they are intended to be used with.  As of now, we'll only discuss the
functions related to work sessions as such.
</p>
<p><code>%[sess:cookie]</code> expands to the cookie value, if the session
(and the cookie value) exists, otherwise it returns an empty string.  It is
important to note that this is the cookie's value going to be sent to the
client in the HTTP headers &mdash; which means, from the client's point of
view, that this value is the same as the <em>new</em> value of the cookie.
The <em>old</em> value of the cookie &mdash; the one which was sent to the
server along with the request for this particular page &mdash; can be taken
with <code>%[req:cookie:thalassa_sessid]</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>ifvalid</code>, <code>ifhasuser</code> and
<code>ifloggedin</code> functions are conditional checkers; they all take
two additional arguments: the <em>then</em> value and the <em>else</em>
value, and return the former in case the condition is true and the latter
if it is false.  For <code>ifvalid</code>, the condition is if there is an
established work session, so it can be used like this:
</p>
<pre>
  %[sess:ifvalid:The session is active:You've got no session]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p class="remark">
The <code>ifhasuser</code>'s condition is if the session has an associated
user name, and for <code>ifloggedin</code> the condition is if not only
