<h2 id="overview">Overview<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The dullcgi framework consists of some (but not all) modules from the
<code>thalcgi.cgi</code> program, accompanied with the dedicated module
named <code>dullcgi.o</code>, and is intended to ease creation of
additional (custom) CGI programs for Thalassa-based web sites.  Basically
it enables the user to create a CGI program, which uses its own
configuration file (in <a href="ini_basics.html">ini format</a>) as well as
the <a href="macro_intro.html">macroprocessor</a>.
</p>
<p>In the present version, dullcgi only allows to handle GET requests; also it
doesn't provide access to the session information and user accounts.  This
will likely change in future versions.
</p>
<p>Dullcgi is a <em>framework</em>, not a library in the classic sense.  It
provides its own <code>main</code> function, and expects the user to
provide a function named <code>dullcgi_main</code> and two globally visible
constants of the type <code>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</code>, named
<code>dullcgi_config_path</code> and <code>dullcgi_program_name</code>.
</p>
<p>Facilities provided by the framework are mainly accessed through an object
of the <code>DullCgi</code> class; the object is created by the framework,
and its address is passed to the user-supplied function as its only
parameter.
</p>
<p>The framework is built as a static library archive file (one with the
``<code>.a</code>'' suffix), in which all necessary object files are
placed, not only those from Thalassa own codebase (the
<code>$thalassa/cms/</code> directory), but also all the necessary
libraries from the <code>$thalassa/lib/*</code> subdirectories.  The
archive is named simply <code>dullcgi.a</code>, without the usual
<code>lib</code> prefix, to make it clear <strong>it is not a
library</strong> despite the file is in the static library format.
</p>


<h2 id="getting_started">Getting started<p></h2>
</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to take the <code>$thalassa/examples/testcgi</code>
directory's content as a kind of starting point.  Well, the user module in
this example is perhaps the simplest thing possible, here is it:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;dullcgi.hpp&gt;
int dullcgi_main(DullCgi *cgi)
{
    cgi->SendPage("default");
    return 0;
}
const char *dullcgi_config_path = "test.ini";
const char *dullcgi_program_name = "TEST";
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>As you might guess, the <code>dullcgi_config_path</code> constant's value
sets the name for the configuration file the framework must read.  The
<code id="progname">dullcgi_program_name</code> constant is a more or less
arbitrary name for your CGI program; it is only used as a part of the
default error page, which is displayed only in case the framework couldn't
read the configuration file.
</p>
<p>The <code>dullcgi_main</code> function in this (perhaps the simplest
possible) version causes the framework to unconditionally send to the
client the HTML page configured by the <code>[page default]</code> section
within the configuration file.  Please note the function
returns&nbsp;<code>0</code>; the value it returns is then returned by the
framework from its <code>main</code> function, so it becomes the exit code
for the whole CGI program.  You should only return a non-zero value in case
everything went so wrong that you don't want even an error message to be
sent back to the requesting client; well, hardly you'll ever need it.
</p>
<p>A really simple configuration
example is provided in the <code>dumb.ini</code> file (yes, it's not the
default version), here is the full contents of the file:
</p>
<pre>
[page default]

template = &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="us-ascii"?&gt;
+&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
+             "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
+&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en" xml:lang="en"&gt;
+  &lt;head&gt;
+    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=us-ascii" /&gt;
+    &lt;title&gt;Simple test CGI program with dumb configuration&lt;/title&gt;
+  &lt;/head&gt;
+  &lt;body&gt;
+    &lt;h1&gt;It WORKS!&lt;/h1&gt;
+  &lt;/body&gt;
+&lt;/html&gt;
+
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The simplest version of the CGI program doesn't detect any errors on its
own, only the errors detected by the framework are processed, so it is more
or less acceptable to have no custom error page.  The default page in this
example is configured in the simplest possible way &mdash; its full text is
given, with no calls to macros.  If you decide to follow this way in your
own configuration, please <strong>keep in mind that the percent char
&ldquo;<code>%</code>&rdquo; is used by the macroprocessor to recognize
macro calls</strong>, so in case you need the &ldquo;<code>%</code>&rdquo;
char in your text, the char must be doubled.
</p>
<p>To build your CGI program, first make sure the <code>dullcgi.a</code> file
is ready for use; it builds by default if you just order your Thalassa
sources to build with a simple ``<code>make</code>'' command.  Then, a
command like
</p>
<pre>
   THAL=path/to/your/thalassa/directory \
      g++ -Wall -g -I${THAL}/cms -I${THAL}/lib mycgi.cpp \
      ${THAL}/cms/dullcgi.a -o mycgi.cgi
<p></pre>
will do the thing.
</p>
<p>You might want to authomate the things a bit, using a
<code>Makefile</code>.  A reasonable simplistic example of such file is
provided in the same directory.
</p>



<h2 id="config_file">Configuration file<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The first thing the dullcgi framework does after the CGI program start is
reading and parsing the configuration file.  In case this fails, the
framework emits its default (hardcoded) error page and quits; the
user-supplied function doesn't even get the control.
</p>
<p>Normally, the configuration file, which has the
<a href="ini_basics.html">ini format</a>, should contain: </p>
<ul>

<li>one or more <code>[page&nbsp;<em>NNN</em>]</code> sections (where
<code><em>NNN</em></code> is an internal page identifier, intended for the
user-supplied code to identify the desired page);</li>

<li><code>[html]</code> section which contains snippets and templates;</li>

<li><code>[errorpage]</code> that defines the error page template;</li>

<li><code>[redirectpage]</code> that defines the page sent to the client
along with a redirect directive.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>The very minimum here is a single <code>[page&nbsp;<em>NNN</em>]</code>
section, as it is shown in the <a href="#getting_started">getting
started</a> section.  Parameters recognized within each of the
configuration sections are documented below.
</p>
<p>Besides the configuration sections and parameters recognized by the dullcgi
framework, the configuration file may contain any information specific for
a particular CGI program.  The <code>DullCgi</code> class provides a method
to access such custom parameters.
</p>
<p>The present version of dullcgi recognizes exactly one parameter, named
<code>template</code>, for each of the page-defining sections
(<code>[page&nbsp;<em>NNN</em>]</code>, <code>[errorpage]</code> and
<code>[redirectpage]</code>).  The parameter's value is passed through the
macroprocessor to make the full page text.
</p>

<p><span id="context_specific_macros"></span>
In the <code id="errorpage_section">[errorpage]</code>
<code>template</code> parameter's value, three additional macros are
recognized:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>%progname%</code> expands to the <em>program name</em> as set by
the <a href="#progname"><code>dullcgi_program_name</code></a>
constant;</li>

<li><code>%errcode%</code> expands to the HTML error code for the error to
be reported, like <code>404</code>, <code>500</code> etc.;</li>

<li><code>%errmessage%</code> expands to the HTML error message, like
<code>page not found</code>.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>In the <code id="redirectpage_section">[redirectpage]</code>
<code>template</code> parameter's value, the framework recognizes one
additional macro, named <code>url</code>, which expands to the target URL
for the redirection being processed.
</p>
<p>The <code>[html]</code> section of the configuration file, introduced to
contain text snippets and simple templates, works exactly the same way as
<a href="general_configuration.html#html_section"><code>[html]</code>
sections</a> for both static content generator and the
<code>thalcgi.cgi</code> program (use the link for details).
</p>


<h2 id="macros">Macros<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The dullcgi framework makes all <a href="common_macros.html">common
macros</a> available in the configuration file.  Besides that, the
following macros are made available by the framework and work exactly the
same way as for the <code>thalcgi.cgi</code> program:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="thalcgi_baseconf.html#req_macro"><code>%[req: ]</code></a></li>
<li><a href="thalcgi_baseconf.html#getenv_macro"><code>%[getenv: ]</code></a></li>
<li><a href="thalcgi_baseconf.html#html_section"><code>%[html: ]</code></a></li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Some <a href="#context_specific_macros">context-specific macros</a> may
also be in effect within certain configuration parameters.
</p>
<p>Besides that, the user-supplied (that is, your) module can introduce
additional macros using the <code>DullCgi</code> class methods.
</p>


<h2 id="dullcgi_class">Using the <code>DullCgi</code> class object<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The function <code>dullcgi_main</code>, which your module must provide, is
called by the framework with the address of <code>DullCgi</code> class
object as its argument.  All features of the framework are mostly accessed
through this object.
</p>
<p>Before we go on with the object's methods documentation, please note the
classes provided by the <a href="scriptpp.html">Scriptpp library</a> are
heavily used by these methods.  Be sure to take a look at the brief
overview of the library (follow the link for it) before reading the
<code>DullCgi</code> class interface documentation, or else you're at risk
not to understand anything.
</p>
<p>To be really short, let's remind that <code>ScriptVariable</code> is a
class representing strings, <code>ScriptVector</code> represents a
(resizeable) vector of strings.  The Scriptpp library also provides
implementation for the macroprocessor used by Thalassa CMS; the
macroprocessor itself is represented by the
<code>ScriptMacroprocessor</code> class (or its descendant), and every
macro is implemented by a subclass of the (abstract) class
<code>ScriptMacroprocessorMacro</code>.
</p>
<p>It is also useful to keep in mind that <code>ScriptVariable</code> provides
a converting constructor for <code>const&nbsp;char*</code>, so for all
arguments of type <code>const&nbsp;ScriptVariable&amp;</code> you can use
simple string literals (in doublequotes).
</p>


   <h3 id="config_access">Accessing the configuration file<p></h3>
</p>
<p>It is highly likely you'll want your configuration file to hold some
parameters specific to your very particular CGI program.  From within the
<code>dullcgi_main</code> function, as well as from any other (your)
function you passed the <code>DullCgi</code> object pointer to, you can
access the configuration file contents with the following method:
</p>
<pre>
    ScriptVariable GetConfigValue(const ScriptVariable &amp;sectgrp,
                                  const ScriptVariable &amp;sect,
                                  const ScriptVariable &amp;param,
                                  const ScriptVariable &amp;specifier,
                                  bool expand_macros) const;
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The first four parameters determine what information you'd like to access,
while the last one (<code>expand_macros</code>) tells the framework whether
should the information extracted from the config file get passed through
the macroprocessor before it will be returned to you.
</p>
<p>To understand the first four parameters, suppose you have something like
</p>
<pre>
  [foo bar]
  manager:friday = John
  manager = Alice
<p></pre>
in your configuration file.  Then, to get that name <code>John</code>, you
should use code like this:
</p>
<pre>
  ScriptVariable manager_name =
      cgi->GetConfigValue("foo", "bar", "manager", "friday", true);
<p></pre>
(use <code>manager_name.c_str()</code> after that to get the C string).
Please note that the parameter value given with no
<a href="ini_basics.html#parameter_specifiers">specifier</a>
(<code>Alice</code>) serves as a kind of default, so it will be
returned for any value of the <code>specifier</code> argument other than
<code>"friday"</code>.  You can use <code>0</code> (which produces
&ldquo;invalid&rdquo; <code>ScriptVariable</code>) if you just need the
default value.
</p>
<p>In case the section you're trying to access is not a part of a group, that
is, its name consists of only one word, then the second argument for the
method must be left zero, too.  So, if you've got smth. like
</p>
<pre>
  [abra]
  cadabra = blah-blah
<p></pre>
then use
</p>
<pre>
      cgi->GetConfigValue("abra", 0, "cadabra", 0, true);
<p></pre>
to get that <code>"blah-blah"</code> value.
</p>
<p>Sometimes these <a href="ini_basics.html#sectiongroups">section groups</a>
can be used to define a kind of an array, or a list, or whatever else you
actually don't know the number of elements nor their names in advance;
actually, Thalassa CMS heavily uses this capability, e.g., to create
<a href="lists.html#ini_based_lists">ini-based lists</a>.  If you do
something like that in your configuration file, you might want to be able
to figure out which sections there are in a given section group.  This is
done by the
</p>
<pre>
    int GetSectionNames(const ScriptVariable &amp;group_id,
                        ScriptVector &amp;names) const;
<p></pre>
method.  Suppose your configuration file contains the following:
</p>
<pre>
  [item foo]
  enable = yes

  [item bar]
  enable = yes

  [item bazz]
  enable = yes
<p></pre>
(it is critical to have at least one non-empty parameter in each of the
sections).  Then, you can act like this:
</p>
<pre>
      ScriptVector names;
      int count;
      count = cgi->GetSectionNames("item", names);
<p></pre>
After that, the <code>count</code> variable will contain the
number&nbsp;<code>3</code>, and the <code>name</code> object will hold
three strings: <code>"foo"</code>, <code>"bar"</code> and
<code>"bazz"</code>.
</p>


   <h3 id="macroprocessor_control">Controlling the macroprocessor<p></h3>
</p>
<p>The framework creates the macroprocessor object on its own, filling it with
the <a href="#macros">predefined macros</a>.  You can control the
macroprocessor to some extent.  To work with it, you will perhaps need to add
</p>
<pre>
  #include &lt;scriptpp/scrmacro.hpp&gt;
<p></pre>
to your module.
</p>
<p>To add your own macro, specific to your CGI program, either derive
a class from
<a href="scriptpp.html#macro_class"><code>ScriptMacroprocessorMacro</code></a>,
or use one of the predefined classes, such as
<code>ScriptMacroConst</code> or <code>ScriptMacroScrVar</code>.
Make an object with operator <code>new</code> and pass the pointer to the
framework using the method
</p>
<pre>
    void AddMacro(ScriptMacroprocessorMacro *p);
<p></pre>
Please note the ownership over the object is considered to be transferred
here, that is, once you called this method, the macro object from now on
belongs to the macroprocessor and will be deleted by its destructor.
That's why it <strong>must</strong> be created with <code>new</code> and in
no other way.
</p>
<p>You can set the vector of
<a href="scriptpp.html#positionals"><code>positionals</code></a> for the
macroprocessor using metod
</p>
<pre>
    void SetPositionals(const ScriptVector &amp;v);
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to add some macros locally, perform some
transformations, then forget the macros.  This may be achieved by creating
a temporary (local) clone of the macroprocessor.  The <code>DullCgi</code>
class provides the following two methods for that:
</p>
<pre>
    ScriptMacroprocessor *MakeMacroprocessorClone() const;
    static void DisposeMacroprocessorClone(ScriptMacroprocessor *p);
<p></pre>
Please keep in mind that objects of macros you pass to the local clone will
belong to the clone and will be deleted once you dispose the clone object.
</p>



   <h3 id="sending_response">Sending the response to the client<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Once you're done with all preparations and other things your CGI might need
to complete, you must tell the framework what actually to send to the
client.  To do so you must call exactly one of the following methods:
</p>
<pre>
    void SendPage(const ScriptVariable &amp;pgid);
    void SendErrorPage(int code, const ScriptVariable &amp;cmt);
    void SendRedirect(const ScriptVariable &amp;url);
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The <code>SendPage</code> method is used in case everything is Ok, so your
program should just send a web page to the client.  The page must be
configured in the <a href="#config_file">configuration file</a> using a
<code>page</code> section, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  [page mypage]
  template = ...
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>To instruct the framework that this page is the one to be sent, simply use
a statement like this:
</p>
<pre>
    cgi->SendPage("mypage");
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The text taken from the respective <code>template</code> parameter will be
passed through the macroprocessor, and the result will be sent to the
client with the &ldquo;success&rdquo; code (<code>200</code>).
</p>
<p>In case something went wrong, you might want to call the
<code>SendErrorPage</code> instead of <code>SendPage</code>, like this:
</p>
<pre>
    cgi->SendErrorPage(404, "page not found");
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>or even
</p>
<p><span id="teapot"></span>
</p>
<pre>
    cgi->SendErrorPage(418, "i'm a teapot");
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>(to have an idea what's the matter with teapots here, please read
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol#Save_418_movement">this
Wikipedia article</a>).
</p>
<p>The page sent to the client will be generated using the
<a href="#errorpage_section"><code>[errorpage]</code> section</a> of the
configuration file.
</p>
<p>Please note that, although the framework really tries to set the error code
in the <code>Status</code> field of the response, in most cases the HTTP
server has its own idea what to send to the client in that field.
</p>
<p>The last possibility is to request the client to redirect the user to some
other place.  It is done like this:
</p>
<pre>
    cgi->SendRedirect("http://www.example.com/place/to/go");
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Together with the redirect response, a &ldquo;backup&rdquo; page is usually
sent, which informs the user what's going on and provides a link to click
in case something went wrong with the browser's ablility to redirect
authomatically.  The dullcgi framework generates a page for this purpose
using the <a href="#redirectpage_section"><code>[redirectpage]</code>
section</a>.
