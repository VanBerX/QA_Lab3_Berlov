<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Site contact form is a Thalassa CGI feature that lets people to contact the
site's team by sending email messages to some predefined email addresses.
Besides the obvious input fields for a sender address, a subject and a
message body, the user should be provided with the ability to choose a
<em>category</em> from a predefined list.  More or less good examples of
categories are &ldquo;technical support&rdquo;, &ldquo;legal questions&rdquo;, &ldquo;vacancies&rdquo;,
&ldquo;report a typo&rdquo; and the like.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to preselect a category using URIs.  This may be useful
in case a link to the contact form is to be placed somewhere at the site,
like &ldquo;contact our tech support department for details&rdquo;, so the particular
category is too obvious to leave the choice to the user.
</p>
<p>Each category has its title, intended to be visible for the user; a
separate email address can be specified for each category, but a default
address can be set as well, so one can specify the default address and
specific addresses for <em>some</em> (but not necessarily <em>all</em>)
categories.
</p>
<p>To have a contact form on the site, one first needs to configure
categories, composing rules and email sending command; this is done with a
<a href="#feedback_section"><code>[feedback]</code> ini section</a>.
Besides that, a page (or multiple pages) must be
<a href="#page_tips">configured</a> to display the feedback webform and
to accept <code>POST</code> requests with the <code>feedback</code> action.
</p>


<h2 id="feedback_action">The <code>feedback</code> action and the web form<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <a href="thalcgi_webforms.html#list_of_actions">action</a> that
performs sending feedback messages is named <code>feedback</code>.  Unlike
all actions we discussed before, this action accepts an optional argument
&mdash; the name of the preselected feedback category, if there is one.
It is intended to be used on a
<a href="thalcgi_pages.html#multipath">multipath page</a>, e.g.:
</p>
<pre>
  [page contact]
  action = feedback %1%
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>This type of setup intends that at URI like
<code>/thalcg.cgi/contact</code> a form will appear that allows the user
to select the feedback category manually, while URIs like
<code>/thalcg.cgi/contact/legal</code> will display generally the same
form, but with the &ldquo;category&rdquo; input disabled and the actual category
(<code>legal</code> in this example) already selected.
</p>
<p>This is not necessary though.  If you're really sure you don't need to
preselect feedback categories by specifying them in the URI, you can use a
simplified setup, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  [page /contact]
  action = feedback
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>In this case, the <code>/thalcg.cgi/contact</code> &ldquo;page&rdquo; will have no
&ldquo;subdirectories&rdquo;, as it is usual for non-multipath pages.
</p>
<p>Finally, you can make your URI totally unrelated to the preselected
feedback category, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  [page /attorneys/contact_the_lawyer.html]
  action = feedback legal
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The <code>feedback</code> action expects the following field values:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>name</code> &mdash; the name of the user, as the user wants to
self-introduce; Thalassa CGI checks this field for being non-empty;</li>

<li><code>mail</code> &mdash; the email address of the user; this is
checked to be a <a href="thalcgi_user_accounts.html#valid_email">valid
email address</a>;</li>

<li><code>category</code> &mdash; the feedback category ID, <em>as selected
by the user with the form's input object</em> (in contrast with selected by
the action argument); in the present version it is only used to choose the
recipient email address, so actually, in case a default email address is
configured, the client can send any crap here and still pass the
checks;</li>

<li><code>subject</code> &mdash; the subject string for the message;
checked for being non-empty;</li>

<li><code>msgbody</code> &mdash; the body of the message;
checked for being non-empty.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>

<p>For a multipath feedback page, you might want to define a path predicate,
like this:
</p>
<pre>
  path_predicate =
  +%[if:%1%:
  +   %[if:%2%:no:
  +      %[ifbelongs:%1%:%[feedback:categories]:yes:no]
  +      :no
  +   ] :
  +   yes
  +]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>This predicate allows the 1-token URI (e.g.,
<code>/thalcg.cgi/contact</code>), disallows URIs with more than two tokens
(e.g., <code>/thalcg.cgi/contact/alpha/beta</code>) and only allows 2-token
URIs in case the second token is an ID of an existing (configured) feedback
category.  The <code>feedback</code> macro is
<a href="#feedback_macro">discussed below</a>.
</p>



<h2 id="feedback_section">The <code>[feedback]</code> section<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <code>[feedback]</code> configuration section contains parameters that
set up categories (<code>categories</code>, <code>cattitle</code>,
<code>selected</code>, <code>email</code>) and email composition and
sending (<code>envelope_from</code>, <code>send_command</code>,
<code>send_data</code>).  This section is <strong>not</strong> responsible
for displaying the web form and handling its <code>POST</code> request;
</p>

   <h3 id="categories_conf">Configuring categories<p></h3>
</p>
<p>To configure feedback categories, one needs first to enumerate the
categories, which is done by setting the <code>categories</code> parameter.
The parameter's value is a whitespace-separated list of category
identifiers; the identifiers are used as
<a href="ini_basics.html#parameter_specifiers">specifiers</a> to other
parameters, so it is strongly recommended to use only low-case latin
letters, digits and possibly the underscore in them.  For the
abovementioned list of category examples, the respective
<code>categories</code> parameter may be as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  categories = tech_support legal vacancies typo_report
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Titles for categories are set by the <code>cattitle</code> parameter using
category IDs as specifiers, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  cattitle:tech_support = Technical support
  cattitle:legal = Legal questions
  cattitle:vacancies = Jobs and vacancies
  cattitle:typo_report = Report a typo on the site
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Email addresses tp which the feedback should be sent are set by the
<code>email</code> parameter.  Category IDs may be used as specifiers to
set email addresses on a per-category basis, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  email:tech_support = support@example.com
  email:legal = legal@example.com
  email:vacancies = carrier@example.com
  email:typo_report = webmaster@example.com
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>It is also possible to have specific addresses for <em>some</em> categories
and a last-resort address for all the ohers:
</p>
<pre>
  email:tech_support = support@example.com
  email:typo_report = webmaster@example.com
  email = info@example.com
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Certainly, you can direct all your feedback to one common address, not
using the per-category configuration, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  email = feedback@example.com
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The last category-related parameter is <code>selected</code>, it allows to
choose what category is to be selected by default.  To do so, the value for
this parameter <em>specific for the desired category</em> must be set to
&ldquo;<code>yes</code>&rdquo;, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  selected:typo_report = yes
<p></pre>
</p>


   <h3 id="envelope_from">The &ldquo;envelope from&rdquo; address<p></h3>
</p>
<p>It might be critical for successful mail delivery to set the <em>envelope
from</em> email address correctly.  This thing often appears confusing for
people not familiar with email system, so some explanations may be useful.
</p>
<p>The header of a email message is nothing but a part of the message, and it
plays mostlty a decorative role, in the sense it doesn't affect the message
delivery process.  This is true for the <code>From:</code> and
<code>To:</code> headers as well.  One can even put a complete crap there.
What <strong>really</strong> matters for delivery &mdash; that is, for
servers (MTAs) that implement the SMTP protocol and actually send and
receive electronic mail &mdash; are the addresses specified within the SMTP
session, <strong>outside</strong> of the message itself.  Each message has
exactly one associated <em>sender address</em> and one or more
<em>recipient addresses</em>; these addresses don't need to be included in the
message itself, because servers communicate them separately.  Informally
these addresses are known as <em>envelope addresses</em>.
</p>
<p>The envelope addresses of the recipients aren't a thing to worry about in
the context of the site contact form; the addresses specified for the
<code>email</code> parameter (see above) will be used, and as these
addresses presumably are controlled by the same team as the site itself,
perhaps everything will be okay.
</p>
<p>What's important to note is that the sender's address is entered into the
form by the user, so its correctness can not be guaranteed nor even
verified.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, SMTP servers nowadays tend to implement various anti-spam
techniques, and some of them, like SPF, can't do anything useful against a
professional spammer, but build serious barriers on the way of legitimate
emails, such as forwarded ones, and ruin correctly maintained mailing lists
(to which users subscribe on their own using email confirmation mechanism).
Good or bad, all these techniques can lead to rejection (as &ldquo;spam&rdquo;) of a
message that comes from a source &ldquo;unexpected&rdquo; for the domain name of the
sender address.  E.g., if the user specifies an address at Gmail, or Yahoo,
or whatever the like, mails &ldquo;from&rdquo; such address are &ldquo;expected&rdquo; to come
from Gmail or Yahoo, <em>not</em> from your poor web server.
</p>
<p>The good news is that it is <strong>the &ldquo;envelope from&rdquo;</strong> address
which is checked in most cases, not the address specified in the
<code>From:</code> header of the message.  So, the more or less reliable
setup will be to place into the <code>From:</code> header whatever the user
entered in the form, but <strong>set the &ldquo;envelope from&rdquo; to an address
in a domain that you own or at least control</strong>, such as the same
domain as for your site.  Domain name of the mail system you use to send
your messages via may work here, too, in case you are too afraid to run a
first-class SMTP server on your own.  Well... it may appear a far simpler
thing than you expect, but it's still up to you.
</p>
<p>The address you use may either be an unattended address, forwarded right to
<code>/dev/null</code>, or an address someone reads emails on &mdash; such
as the webmaster's address.  It is, again, up to you.  In most cases, only
the domain name matters for all these anti-spam checkers.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;envelope from&rdquo; address is set by the <code>envelope_from</code>
parameter of the <code>[feedback]</code> section, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  envelope_from = thalassa_master@example.com
<p></pre>
</p>


   <h3 id="feedback_macro">The <code>%[feedback:&nbsp;]</code> macro<p></h3>
</p>
<p>The categories-related part of the feedback configuration, as well as the
configured &ldquo;envelope from&rdquo; address, are available via the
<code>feedback</code> macro.  The macro has four functions.  Two of them
don't need additional arguments: <code>%[feedback:categories]</code>
returns the space-separated list of categories, as set by the
<code>categories</code> parameter, and <code>%[feedback:envfrom]</code>
returns the configured &ldquo;envelope from&rdquo; address.
</p>
<p>The <code>cattitle</code> function accepts one additional argument &mdash;
the category ID &mdash; and returns the title for the given category.
E.g., for the example given above, <code>%[feedback:cattitle:legal]</code>
will return the string &ldquo;Legal questions&rdquo; as configured by the
<code>cattitle:legal</code> parameter.
</p>
<p>The <code>ifcatsel</code> function is a conditional checker.  It accepts
three additional arguments: the category ID, the <em>then</em> value and
the <em>else</em> value.  In case the given category is set to be
preselected by the <code>selected</code> parameter, the <em>then</em>
argument is returned, otherwise the function returns its <em>else</em>
argument.
</p>
<p>The macro is used both in the resting parameters of the
<code>[feedback]</code> section and in the page template that composes the
actual feedback webform.
</p>


   <h3 id="email_conf">Email composition and sending configuration<p></h3>
</p>
<p>The rest of the <code>[feedback]</code> section are two parameters,
<code>send_command</code> and <code>send_data</code>.  Within their values,
the <a href="#feedback_macro"><code>feedback</code> macro</a> should be
actively used.  Besides that, the context-specific <code>%receiver%</code>
macro is available.  And, the last but not least, you can use the <a href="thalcgi_baseconf.html#req_macro">%[req:param:&nbsp;] macro
function</a> to access data from the web form, typed by the user; e.g.,
<code>%[req:param:mail]</code> should be the user's email, etc.
</p>
<p>The <code>send_command</code> parameter is a command line (name and
arguments) for the external program to launch to send the message;
arguments are split down to words, using the apostrophe &ldquo;<code>'</code>&rdquo;
and the doublequote &ldquo;<code>"</code>&rdquo; as grouping symbols (both an
apostrophe within doublequotes and a doublequote within apostrophes are
considered as plain chars).  As usual, the message itself will be supplied
to the command's standard input.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
  send_command = /usr/sbin/sendmail -bm -i
  +                -f %[feedback:envfrom] '%[receiver]'
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The <code>send_data</code> parameter is a template for the whole message,
including the headers and the body.  <strong>Be sure to leave an empty
line between the header and the body, and not to insert empty lines before
or in the middle of the header</strong>.  Thalassa CGI doesn't check
anything here on its own, but the message will likely be rejected by the
MTA if composed incorrectly.  Here's an example of the template:
</p>
<pre>
  send_data = From: %[req:param:mail]
  +To: %[receiver]
  +Subject: %[req:param:subject]
  +MIME-Version: 1.0
  +Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
  +Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8Bit
  +X-Sender-Software: Thalassa CGI script
  +X-Sender-Form: %[req:host]%[req:script]%[req:path]
  +
  += "%[req:param:name]", using the site contact form, wrote:
  +
  +%[req:param:msgbody]
  +
<p></pre>
</p>
