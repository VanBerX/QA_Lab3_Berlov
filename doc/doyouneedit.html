    <h1 class="page_title"><a href="">When you do and when you don't need Thalassa CMS</a></h1>
    <div class="page_body">
<p>Just like any other tool, Thalassa CMS has its own strong sides and its own
boundaries.  Here they are.
</p>
<h2>100% no-goes<p></h2>
</p>
<p>You will be definitely unable to use Thalassa CMS if at least one of the
following is true for you:
</p>
<ol>

<li>you use Windows and don't know how to deal with Unix-like OSes;</li>

<li>you don't know HTML, even basics of it;</li>

<li>you hate to edit configuration files;</li>

<li>terms such as <em>command line</em>, <em>macroprocessor</em>,
<em>relative path</em> and the like nearly make you panic;</li>

<li>you believe a splendid presentation in PowerPoint may in some cases be
more important than the subject it is devoted to;</li>

<li>when it comes to IT, you suppose the newer is always the better.</li>

<p></ol>
</p>
<p>Really, this list can save you a lot of time.  We strive
to be honest.
</p>

<h2>&ldquo;Wrong choice&rdquo; cases<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Thalassa CMS is perhaps not what you need if:</p>
<ul>

<li>Your site is going to consist of exactly one page.  Or even of two
pages.  With three pages, Thalassa might be worth trying.</li>

<li>You are going to create a real monster, like, well, another facebook
&mdash; or something else with millions of pages, billions of comments and
zillions of requests per second.  As of now, the largest site made with
Thalassa has only about 300 pages, less than 4000 comments and several
hundreds unique visitors a day; we've got no idea where its limits really
are.  (From the other hand, what on Earth can be more efficient than
content stored and served as static HTML files?  Thalassa does exactly
this, but, once again, we never tested it with huge sites)</li>

<li>It is critical for you to create and edit pages on your site
through a web interface (or maybe let others do).  In the present version,
Thalassa only gives web-based access to comments, which means its CGI
program allows to leave new comments, edit existing comments and perform
moderation; but that's all.  Regular pages are still to be created,
modified and deleted by means of editing files; Thalassa only takes the
responsibility to generate all common things such as headers, footers,
menus and the like.</li>

<li>You'd like a lot of random people to have access to your site's content
manipulation (except for comments).  For example, you want to create
another &ldquo;platform&rdquo; for people to write their own blogs.
Later versions
might have features for this, but the present version doesn't.</li>

<li>You need visitors to be able to login using their accounts registered
somewhere else, such as social media accounts, google accounts etc.</li>

<li>You're sure you need to keep detailed track of what a visitor does at
your site.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>


<h2>Closer matches<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Here are some cases Thalassa may serve you good:</p>
<ul>

<li>you need a relatively small site, like a personal blog, or a site
devoted to an exotic hobby &mdash; with or without user comments;</li>

<li>you only need a bunch (well... 10 to 1000, or even 3 to 100'000) of
HTML pages with similar appearance;</li>

<li>you've got a Unix machine on Internet, running an MTA like Exim or
Postfix, and you wanna have a web form that allows visitors to send emails
to you and maybe several others;</li>

<li>you're short of resources (like RAM and CPU) on your server.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>


<h2>&ldquo;Bingo!&rdquo; cases<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Finally, here are the cases when Thalassa CMS may be not just the only
possible choice, but may even appear to be the thing you were many years
waiting for:</p>
<ul>

<li>you are tired of all these "no problem" ecosystems of Perl, Python,
Ruby and the like, devouring your time like piranhas;</li>

<li>you've got more than enough of these "simple and reliable" SQL engines,
which are, well, very easy to operate and certainly never fail;</li>

<li>someone just told you that CMS you chose for your site several years
ago becomes unsupported now, and there's no way to keep all your content
migrating to something newer; or, maybe, nobody actually told you so but
you've once seen it in a nightmare;</li>

<li>you're familiar with git (or any other distributed versioning tool) and
you'd like to deploy an exact copy of your site on your local computer with
next to no effort;</li>

<li>you hate JavaScript (and, broadly speaking, the idea of executing
anything inside the visitor's browser) at least half as strong as we
do;</li>

<li>every time when another damn &ldquo;modern&rdquo; site tells you that your
browser is &ldquo;outdated&rdquo; or the like, you feel you'd love to sentence its
creators to death penalty;</li>

<li>today's morning you were pissed off by another site your browser hanged
trying to show;</li>

<li>you've just read the whole page until this point.</li>

<p></ul>
