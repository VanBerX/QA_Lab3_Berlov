<h2 id="preamble">Preamble<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Technical standards are used to be commitee-made.  From the other hand, it
is well-known that commitees, by their very nature, are unable to produce
anything useful.  In the very best case, commitee-made things are useless,
but far more often they are seriously harmful.
</p>
<p>Speaking particularly about programming languages, the commitees are used
to issue a <em>command</em> to the whole world &mdash; from now on, the
language that people know becomes totally different and everyone must
agree.
</p>
<p>It looks obvious that no one in the world can have powers to command to the
whole world.  No one, never ever.  If governments let various &ldquo;standard
bodies&rdquo;, such as ISO, do what they do, this only means the governments
went far beyond the limits of acceptable.
</p>
<p>C99 and later &ldquo;standards&rdquo; explain languages which are totally different,
and they has nothing to do with the C language; only C90 was more or less
close to what the C language is.  The same is true for the C++ language,
but starting with the very first &ldquo;standard&rdquo;, issued in 1998.  None of the
so-called &ldquo;C++ standards&rdquo; ever had anything in common with what C++
really is.
</p>
<p>Honest behaviour would be to give these specifications different names.
There are examples of such well behaviour in history, such as the language
named Scheme, despite everyone understand it is just another Lisp dialect.
Even C++ itself is an example of a more or less honest naming: although the
name obviously suggests that it is the same C but better, it is still a
different name, and Stroustrup never tried to convince the world that plain
C is from now on obsoleted and C++ should be used instead.
</p>
<p>Having said this, it becomes clear that what standard commitees do is,
plainly speaking, <em>fraud</em>.  Industry is conservative, and it is very
hard to convince it to adopt a completely new language; so the commitees
use the names of well-known languages to endorse what they create.
</p>
<p>BTW, even if we take these standards simply as specifications for new
languages, they are horrible.  It's because the commitee members hold no
responsibility for what they do.  They even don't have to implement their
own ideas, they only need to vote for it, and other people will have no
other choice but to implement what the commitee voted for.
</p>
<p>We can't stop the commitees, at least right now.  We've got no power to
scatter them.  But there's one thing we can do right now: namely, we can
boycott everyhting the damn commitees do.  So, let's do at least what we
can.
</p>


<h2 id="include">#include"" vs. #include&lt;&gt;<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Before the commitees touched all this with their dirty hands, the
difference between <code>#include&nbsp;""</code> and
<code>#include&nbsp;&lt;&gt;</code> was obvious: the form
<code>#include&nbsp;""</code> was used for the headers that belong to your
program itself, while <code>#include&nbsp;&lt;&gt;</code> was for the
header files external to your program, that is, headers from
<em>libraries</em>, no matter whether it is the so-called &ldquo;standard&rdquo;
library or any other.
</p>
<p>In particular, for Thalassa, all the libraries included within the source
tarball <em>are still libraries</em>, so their headers MUST be included
with </code>#include&nbsp;&lt;&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>#include&nbsp;""</code> form is only to be used for headers that
reside within the <code>cms/</code> subdirectory.
</p>

<h2 id="cplusplus">Restrictions for C++<p></h2>
</p>
  <h3 id="nostdlib">No C++ standard library<p></h3>
</p>
<p>The so-called standard library of C++ must not be used in any form.  Simply
speaking, you <strong>must not</strong> include any header files that have
no &ldquo;.h&rdquo; suffix <em>and</em> you must not use any names from that damn
&ldquo;namespace std&rdquo;, neither with explicit <code>std::</code> prefix, nor
with the <code>using namespace</code> directive (as we'll see in the next
section, the <code>using</code> directive is prohibited as such, because
namespaces themselves are prohibited).
</p>
<p>Compilers usually provide &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; headers such as
<code>iostream.h</code>, <code>vector.h</code> and the like.  These are
prohibited, too.
</p>
<p>Definitely it is strictly forbidden to include &ldquo;plain C compatibility&rdquo;
headers such as <code>cstdio</code>, <code>cstring</code> and so on.  As it
will be mentioned <a href="#libc_subset">later</a>, some header files from
the plain C standard library are not allowed, but many of them are allowed
&mdash; and they <strong>must</strong> be included exactly as you would do
it in plain C.
</p>
<p>People often ask one (stupid) question: <em>okay, but what to use instead
of the standard library?</em>  Sometimes it is possible to answer this
question correctly.  Instead ot iostream, either plain C &ldquo;high-level&rdquo;
input-output may be used (that is, the functions and types declared in
<code>stdio.h</code>), or you can use i/o system calls such as open, close,
read, write etc. directly.  Instead of the (very stupid and ugly)
<code>string</code> class, the particular project (Thalassa CMS) uses the
class named <code>ScriptVariable</code>, defined by <code>scriptpp</code>
library.
</p>
<p>It is very important to understand (and accept!) that <strong>no
replacement for STL templates (containers and algorithms) allowed</strong>,
neither from other libraries, nor written by yoursef.  Data structures are
built exactly the same way as in plain C, manually, for every particular
task.  There is no such thing as &ldquo;generic&rdquo; data structures.  Period.
</p>


  <h3 id="nokeywords">No standard-invented &ldquo;features&rdquo;<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Actually, none of the &ldquo;features&rdquo; introduced by the so-called
&ldquo;standards&rdquo; is allowed here.  Just to start with, your code <strong>must
not</strong> contain any of the following keywords: <code>using</code>,
<code>namespace</code>, <code>typename</code> (the <code>class</code>
keyword is to be used in template arguments that represent types),
<code>nullptr</code> (the numerical <code>0</code> must be used to denote
the null address), <code>auto</code> (damn if you feel you need it, you're
wrong: don't prevent the compiler from detecting your errors!),
<code>constexpr</code>, <code>consteval</code>, <code>constinit</code>,
<code>noexcept</code>, <code>final</code>, <code>override</code>,
<code>import</code>, <code>module</code>, <code>requires</code>,
<code>export</code>, <code>co_yield</code>, <code>co_return</code>,
<code>co_await</code>, <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>char8_t</code>,
<code>char16_t</code>, <code>char32_t</code>, <code>alignas</code>,
<code>alignof</code>, <code>register</code>, <code>static_assert</code>,
<code>thread_local</code>...
</p>
<p>Something may be missing from this list, but you've got the idea: if a new
keyword is &ldquo;added&rdquo; by another damn &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or its meaning changed,
then the keyword is prohibited here.
</p>
<p>Not only keywords are prohibited; all the &ldquo;concepts&rdquo; introduced in these
&ldquo;standards&rdquo; are prohibited, too.  Don't even think about all these
lambdas, coroutines, structured bindings, move semantic (it is when a type
for constructor's argument is declared with <code>&&</code>), variadic
templates etc.
</p>
<p>Once again: everything that comes from C++ &ldquo;standards&rdquo; is prohibited.
Period.
</p>

  <h3 id="novarinfor">No loop var definition within for head<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Please don't do this:
</p>
<pre class="wrongcode">
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Instead, define your loop variable right before the loop head, like this:
</p>
<pre>
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
<p></pre>
</p>

  <h3 id="noexcept">No exception handling<p></h3>
</p>
<p>This is a decision made for this particular project.  Actually, exceptions
don't come from &ldquo;standards&rdquo;, and despite their terrible inefficiency,
sometimes it is okay to use them as they really allow to save a lot of
programmers' time.  However, in Thalassa CMS exceptions are not used.
</p>

  <h3 id="nortty">No RTTI nor dynamic_cast<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Those are not from standards, too, but RTTI is too monstrous, and
dynamic_cast is too slow.  Don't use them both.
</p>

  <h3 id="nomemberptrs">No member pointers<p></h3>
</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with member pointers, except for one
thing: if you really need a member pointer, then your class (or structure,
heh?) is overcomplicated.  Instead of member pointers, better try to
refactor your classes and methods so that they stop being
<strong>that</strong> complicated.
</p>

  <h3 id="nognuextensions">No GNU extensions<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Well, do we really have to mention that horrible things like nested
functions, VLAs and lots of other monsters that gcc supports as
&ldquo;extensions&rdquo; are not to be used?  Heh, actually they are so ugly that
even damn standard commitees don't want to adopt them.
</p>

  <h3 id="defaultargvals">Default argument values<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Default values for arguments of functions and methods are discouraged but
still allowed.  However, we restrict what can serve as the default value.
The standards are too liberal on this.  Within Thalassa code, only explicit
compile-time constants may be used in this role.  These include explicit
numerical, char and string literals, macros that are known to expand to
such literals, and enum constants.  Nothing else is allowed.
</p>

  <h3 id="templates">Templates are okay, but not for containers<p></h3>
</p>
<p>Many similar guides prohibit templates altogether.  This might surprize
you, but here we disagree: within Thalassa CMS, templates as such are
allowed.  What is not allowed is using templates to create generic
container classes and &ldquo;algorithms&rdquo; for them, like STL does.
</p>
<p>People often ask smth. like "hey, but what <em>else</em> templates can be
used for?!"  Okay, if you don't know the answer, then simply don't use
templates at all.  However, once you encounter a small task where
templates can make things better (<strong>not</strong> being used to create
another damn generic container), then, well, recall this section.
</p>


<h2 id="plainc">Restrictions for plain C<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Thalassa CMS is mainly implemented in C++, with only some smaller modules
written in plain C.  However, there actually <strong>is</strong> some plain
C code, so we have to explain what's okay and what's not okay in such code.
</p>
<p>There's one trivial thing we must always remember: C and C++ are two
different programming languages.
</p>

  <h3 id="noc99">No features from C99 and later "standards"<p></h3>
</p>
<p>First of all, it is prohibited to use VLAs.
</p>
<p>Once again, it is prohibited to use VLAs.
</p>
<p>For those who didn't understand: it is prohibited to use VLAs.
</p>
<p>But, well, VLAs are not the only thing to be prohibited.  As a rule,
<strong>C99 is not&nbsp;C</strong>, and all the later crap such as C14 or
C23 has nothing to do with the C language at all; if we write in C, then
let's write in&nbsp;C.
</p>
<p>There are no "line" comments in C, those that start with &ldquo;//&rdquo;.  In plain
C, <strong>only</strong> <code>/* ... */</code> comments are allowed.
</p>
<p>A variable or a type in plain C can only be defined (or even just declared)
either in global space or at the very start of a block; no declarations and
definitions may come after a statement.  So, in particular, this is
illegal:
</p>
<pre class="wrongcode">
  int f(int n)
  {
      int *a;
      a = malloc(n);
      int x;
      /* ... */
  }
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>This is because the variable <code>x</code> is defined <em>after</em> the
<em>statement</em> (the one which contains <code>malloc</code>).  No
more declarations are allowed in the block once at least one statement is
encountered.
</p>
<p>Well, remember we're discussing <strong>plain C</strong> now.  In C++,
declarations may be placed wherever you want, but plain C is not C++.
</p>
<p>Certainly, all these ugly things like complex numbers, wide chars,
L-strings, are not allowed.
</p>
<p>However, there are not so obvious limitations.  First of all, <strong>there
is no <code>bool</code> type in plain C</strong>.  Arithmetic zero stands
for false, any arithmetic non-zero is true, and in case you need to
explicitly specify boolean truth, use <code>1</code>.
</p>
<p>Please don't even think about using various &ldquo;optimization hints&rdquo; such as
the <code>restrict</code> keyword and also these <code>likely</code> and
<code>unlikely</code> macros.  Simply forget about them.
</p>
<p>Also, in plain C <strong>there are no designated initializers, nor compound
literals</strong>.  So, in the following code everything is wrong:
</p>
<pre class="wrongcode">
  struct mystr s1 = { .name = "John", .count = 5, .avg = 2.7 };
  s2 = (struct mystr) { .name = "John", .count = 5, .avg = 2.7 };
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>You may feel pity for these as they are convenient.  The problem is that
they come from &ldquo;standards&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>And one more thing: there are no <code>inline</code> functions in C.
</p>


  <h3 id="libc_subset">Allowed subset of the standard library<p></h3>
</p>
<p>If something is included into the standard C library, this doesn't
automatically mean you should use it.  Tendencies are that one day we'll
have to create our own library to be used instead of the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; one,
and the less we use of the libc now, the less effort it will take to get
rid of it.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is a bit hard to give a complete answer on what is okay
and what is not okay here; may be such answer will be given later.  As of
now, the following is definitely allowed:</p>
<ul>

<li>system call wrappers and their infrastructure such as constant
definitions;</li>

<li>library functions of the <code>exec*</code> family;</li>

<li>the higher-level input/output functions declared in
<code>stdio.h</code>, except for <code>fread</code> and <code>fwrite</code>
which are senseless (use syscalls instead), and the <code>gets</code>
function which must never be used for obvious security reasons;</li>

<li>the <code>errno</code> variable;</li>

<li>the functions <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>,
<code>getenv</code>, <code>setenv</code>, <code>unsetenv</code>,
<code>exit</code> and <code>_exit</code> from the <code>stdlib.h</code>
header file;</li>

<li>the string manipulation functions declared in the <code>string.h</code>
header file;</li>

<li>the math functions declared in the <code>math.h</code>
header file and available with <code>-lm</code>.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>


<p>From the other hand, the following is definitely not allowed:</p>
<ul>

<li>any &ldquo;extensions&rdquo; such as GNU extensions;</li>

<li>everything that depends on locales, such as functions from the
<code>ctype.h</code> header file; we have to make an exception for the
<code>[fvs]printf</code> function family here, and that's a problem, but
perhaps our own version of these functions will not depend on locales;</li>

<li>everything that ruins the possibility to build statically, such as
<code>getpwnam</code> and the company;</li>

<li>everything that uses or depends on threads;</li>

<li>functions invented specially to support threads, usually named with the
<code>_r</code> suffix, such as <code>strtok_r</code>.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>

<p>For all the features not included into either of these lists, the situation
is subject to discussion.  For features that &ldquo;formally&rdquo; appear on both
lists, such as the <code>strtok_r</code> function which is also &ldquo;a
function from string.h&rdquo;, the list of prohibitions has the precedence.
</p>



  <h3 id="nognuextensions">No GNU extensions<p></h3>
</p>
<p>We already discussed this for C++, and we have to repeat it for plain C,
too: horrible things like nested functions and lots of other monsters
invented by gcc team as &ldquo;extensions&rdquo; are not to be used: they are so ugly
that even damn standard commitees don't want to adopt them.
</p>






<h2 id="conlcusion">Conclusion<p></h2>
</p>
<p>This text is <strong>not an invitation for any discussion</strong>.  If you
think we're wrong, feel free to keep that opinion, but please don't waste
your and our time trying to convince us.  Actually, we tend to consider any
attempt to do so as a reason for immediate and permanent ban.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the list of prohibitions given here is thought of as
incomplete, which means more restrictions can be added to it in future.
From the other hand, none of the restrictions will ever be removed.
</p>
<p>Having said all this, we warmly welcome typo reports <strong>and</strong>
corrections for the language this text is written in.  The author is not a
native English speaker, so any feedback on particular wording, grammatics,
all these tenses etc. is appreciated, specially when it comes from native
English speakers.
