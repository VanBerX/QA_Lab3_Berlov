<p>Thalassa CMS is not designed to generate binary files, and is not capable
of it; hence, in case you need any non-textual objects, there's only one
option: to copy it into your site's tree from somewhere else.  And this is
a thing Thalassa can do for you.  Certainly, you can use it to copy text
files as well, if you want so.
</p>

<h2 id="publish_methods">Publishing methods<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Let's first make a note that we hereinafter use the term
&ldquo;<em>publishing</em>&rdquo; to denote <em>any action which results in making a
file or a directory that exists somewhere to be available within the tree of
the site being generated</em>.  The simplest such action is just to
copy the file or directory into the tree, but this is not the only way,
because a hard link or a symbolic link may be created as well.  In case you
generate your content right on the server machine, this really will be
<em>publishing</em>, but if you prefer to generate everything elsewhere and
copy the generated content to the server, formally the term becomes
incorrect.  Despite that, we don't make any difference between the two
situations, so the term <em>publishing</em> is used from now on for placing
files into the generated tree, no matter whether the tree is really public
or not.
</p>
<p>Besides the choice whether the file in question should be copied, linked or
symlinked to the target location, there are other questions to decide on,
specially if not a single file but a whole directory (or a part of it) is
to be published.  Should hidden files (those with names starting with a
dot) be ignored or published?  Should symlinks be &ldquo;followed&rdquo; and handled
as normal files, or copied as is, or ignored?  Should subdirectories be
published recursively with all their content, or ignored, or (if symlink is
selected as the publishing method) symlinked?  Finally, shouldn't anyting
happen with the <em>file mode</em>, that is, with access rights for the
published file?
</p>
<p>The <code>thalassa</code> program is able to perform publishing for single
files, as determined by
<a href="#binary_section"><code>[binary&nbsp;]</code> configuration
section</a>, as well as for directories, configured by
<a href="#collection_section"><code>[collection&nbsp;]</code> sections</a>.
Besides that, the same procedure is done for additional files during
generation of a page that belongs to a
<a href="generation_objects.html#pageset">page set</a>.  For all these
situations, the similar set of questions is to be answered regarding how
exactly the files are to be published, and this is determined by the same
set of parameters:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>publish_method</code> controls whether files are to be copied,
linked or symlinked; the possible values are <code>copy</code>,
<code>link</code> and <code>symlink</code>, case insensitive; <strong>if
the value is not one of these words, publishing for the whole object will
be silently skipped;</strong></li>

<li><code>publish_symlinks</code> determines what is to be done with
symbolic links if they are found in the directory being published;
recognized values are <code>follow</code>, <code>preserve</code> and
<code>ignore</code>; in case the value is empty or not recognized, the
default <code>ignore</code> behaviour is assumed; <code>follow</code> means
symbolic links don't need any special handling, so the files referenced to
by them are processed as if they were found right in the traversed
directory, without any links; <code>preserve</code> means that in the
target directory, a symbolic link will be created with exactly the same
name and value; finally, <code>ignore</code> (or any other value) means
symbolic links will be ignored as if they didn't exist at all;</li>

<li><code>publish_hidden</code> and <code>publish_recursive</code> control
whether hidden files should be published or not, and whether subdirectories
should be recursively traversed (and their contend published) or not; both
are boolean values, which means that the only recognized value is
<code>yes</code>, and anything else, including empty and absent value, are
taken to be &ldquo;no&rdquo;; in this particular case, anything but <code>yes</code>
means the publishing procedure will ignore hidden files or subdirectories,
respectively;</li>

<li><code id="chmod">chmod</code> forces a particular mode (access rights)
to be set
on files being published; the mode must be given as an octal number (see <a href="simple_pages.html#chmod">discussion related to simple pages</a> where
the same parameter is used); please note this parameter <strong>only
affects regular files being copied</strong>; it is ignored for symbolic
links and directories, as well as for <em>publish_method</em>s
other than <code>copy</code>.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>It is a good idea to remember that:</p>
<ul>
<li>hard link can not be made across filesystem borders;</li>
<li>directories can not be hard-linked at all.</li>
<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Macroprocessing is not done in any of these parameters' values, at least in
the present version of Thalassa.
</p>

<h2 id="binary_section">The <code>[binary <em>NNN</em>]</code> section group<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Sections of the <code>[binary <em>NNN</em>]</code> group are designed to
publish a single existing file; despite the name, files are not obliged to
be binaries, the name &ldquo;<code>binary</code>&rdquo; should be taken as
standing for the files that <em>may</em> be binaries.
</p>
<p>Parameters recognized in these sections are <code>source</code> (the name
of the original file), <code>dest</code> (the name and path for the file
inside your generated tree), and all parameters enumerated in the
<a href="#publish_methods">section discussing publish methods</a>, such as
<code>publish_method</code>, <code>chmod</code> etc.
</p>
<p>Both <code>source</code> and <code>dest</code> default to the section name,
so the most minimalistic <code>[binary&nbsp;]</code> may look like this:
</p>
<pre>
  [binary logo.jpg]
  publish_method = copy
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>There is no default for the <copy>publish_method</copy> parameter, and
empty sections are ignored anyway, so perhaps one can't make this more
minimalistic.
</p>
<p>The <code>source</code> value may either be an absolute path, or a relative
one, in which case it is taken relative to the working directory of
<code>thalassa</code> (typically the root of your site sources).  In
contrast, the <code>dest</code> value is always taken to be relative to
the
<a href="general_configuration.html#general_rootdir_parameter">rootdir</a>,
even if it starts with a slash.
</p>
<p>Please note <strong>the <code>dest</code> parameter must contain the file
name</strong>, it can't be just a directory to place the file in.
</p>
<p>In case you always set both <code>source</code> and <code>dest</code>
explicitly, you can use any arbitrary identifier as the name of the
section; only make sure you use different names for different sections, so
that sections are not
<a href="ini_basics.html#joining_sections">joined</a>.
</p>
<p>Both <code>source</code> and <code>dest</code> are passed through the
macroprocessor to make
<a href="general_configuration.html#options">options</a> available.
</p>



<h2 id="collection_section">The <code>[collection <em>NNN</em>]</code> section group<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;<em>collection</em>&rdquo; is used in Thalassa CMS for a set of files
to be published as they are; basically it is a directory containing files.
</p>
<p>Collections are defined with configuration sections named <code>[collection
<em>NNN</em>]</code>, which contain parameters <code>sourcedir</code> (the
collection's origin), <code>destdir</code> (where to place the files inside
your site's tree), and all parameters enumerated in the
<a href="#publish_methods">publish methods</a> section, such as
<code>publish_method</code>, <code>publish_hidden</code> etc.
</p>
<p>Both <code>sourcedir</code> and <code>destdir</code> default to the section
name (that <code>NNN</code> thing).  There is no default for the
<copy>publish_method</copy> parameter, so it must be given explicitly.  See
the <a href="#publish_methods">publish methods</a> section for a discussion
how files are published.
</p>
<p>The <code>sourcedir</code> value may be both an absolute or a relative
path, (relative to the working directory of <code>thalassa</code>,
typically the root of your site sources).  The <code>destdir</code> value is
always taken to be relative to the
<a href="general_configuration.html#general_rootdir_parameter">rootdir</a>,
even if it starts with a slash.  Set the <code>destdir</code> to
&ldquo;<code>/</code>&rdquo; to place files right in the root directory of your site.
</p>
<p>If the <code>publish_recursive</code> is set to <code>yes</code> and there
are subdirectories in your collection source directory, the same directory
subtree will be created inside your web tree, even if the
<code>publish_method</code> is &ldquo;<code>link</code>&rdquo; (please remember that
directories can not be hardlinked).  Furhtermore, the same will happen for
the &ldquo;<code>symlink</code>&rdquo; method; if you want your subdirectories to be
symlinked rather than making the same tree, set
<code>publish_recursive</code> to <code>no</code>.
</p>
<p>Please note there's no way to really ignore subsirectories in the
<code>symlink</code> publish mode, as symbolic links to directories
technically don't differ from symlinks to regular files.
</p>
<p>In case you always set both <code>sourcedir</code> and <code>destdir</code>
explicitly, you can use any arbitrary identifier as the name of the
collection, but make sure you use different names for different
collections.
</p>
<p>Both <code>sourcedir</code> and <code>destdir</code> are passed through the
macroprocessor to make
<a href="general_configuration.html#options">options</a> available.
