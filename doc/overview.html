    <div class="page_body"><p>Thalassa is a CMS written with simplicity in mind.  Clearly, there are
different points of view on what simplicity actually is; the simplicity
provided by Thalassa is best visible from system administrators' and
package maintainers' point of view, as its <strong>list of external
dependencies is reduced to a minimum close to absolute</strong>.

<h3 id="prerequisites">What you need in order to run Thalassa<p></h3>
</p>
<p>To build it, you need:</p>
<ul>

<li>a computer running a Unix-like operating system; Thalassa is mainly
tested on Linux, but will likely work on BSDs or other Unices, including
older ones;</li>

<li>gcc/g++ compiler; it is known to build successfully with gcc 3.4.5,
released in 2004, and perhaps will compile with older versions of gcc,
too; certainly any newer version will also work, unless gcc team decides to
break the backward compatibility;</li>

<li>GNU make; well, it must be easy to create makefiles for POSIX make as
well, but this is not a high-priority task.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>The best news is: <strong>that's all</strong>.  Thalassa doesn't depend on
any external libraries, not even the C++ &ldquo;standard&rdquo; library; it only uses
a (small and obvious) subset of plain C standard library, and all other
libs it needs are found within the source tarball.  It is written using a
very restricted <a href="cpp_subset.html">subset of C++</a> as such &mdash;
actually, the C++ language as it was <strong>before</strong> the so-called
&ldquo;standards&rdquo; turned it into a complete mess (yes, before the very first
damn standard known as C++98).
</p>
<p>With Thalassa, you will never run into dependency hell; it will never force
you into updating, upgrading, renewing or otherwise adapting anything on
your computer.
</p>
<p>And yes, <strong>it does build statically</strong> if you want so.
</p>
<p>What you need <strong>to run a site</strong> managed with Thalassa, depends
on whether you are going to use its interactive features.  If your site is
not intended to be interactive, actually you only need a web server
software capable of providing access to static HTML files, which
effectively means <strong>any</strong> http server.  You don't even have to
run Thalassa on the server computer, it is possible to generate your site
on your own computer and upload the resulting HTML to the server.
</p>
<p>The interactive capabilities of Thalassa currently include user comments
and a contact form; if you need these on your site, you will at least need
to run Thalassa on the server.  Strange enough, this can be problematic, as
many of hosting operators that provide 'shared hosting' service don't allow
to run binary executables within their web space.  Usually they say it's
all for the &ldquo;security&rdquo;, but that's nonsense: if they allow to run
arbitrary code written in ANY language, such as PHP, Python, Perl, NodeJS
and so on, then banning arbitrary binaries does not improve security in any
way, it only creates inconvenience but no real effect.  It is simply stupid
to impose limitations like this, and it is only done by people who don't
understand how computers are attacked and how to keep them secure.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is terribly inconvenient (although possible) to run
Thalassa on a server having no shell access, and shell access is not
available with most of 'shared hosting' services.
</p>
<p>However, the solution is obvious: you always can run your site on a VPS.
Nowadays, a VPS might be even cheaper than shared web-hosting.  Visit,
e.g., <a href="https://lowendbox.com">lowendbox.com</a> to pick a server
under $2 a month (sometimes there are even offers for $1 per month).
Thalassa is so light-weight that you can run literally
<strong>hundreds</strong> of Thalassa-managed sites on a single low-end
VPS, so paying these $2 per month, you can invite all your friends to host
their sites.
</p>
<p>Running sites on a VPS (or, broadly speaking, on a Unix computer you've got
root access to, be it virtual or real) is the thing Thalassa is best suited
for.  With most other CMSes, you might not want to do so, as they rely upon
database management systems, primarily MySQL/MariaDB, so you've got to
install a DMBS, run it, create a database, regularly think about making
backups of it (and yes, it is not so easy to make a backup of a running
database), constantly keep an eye on it, as it tends to fail at the most
terribly inconvenient moment, etc.  Even worse, other CMSes are usually
implemented in interpreted languages with their own <em>ecosystems</em>,
and despite these Python and Ruby fans do their best to convince you there
are no problems with these, the fact is you'll perhaps end up having to put
every single program (including every CMS running a single site) into its
own container, like Docker, which, well, these low-end VPSes are usually
too low-end to run.
</p>
<p>In contrast, Thalassa only consists of two executable binaries, one called
<code>thalassa</code>, which you run to generate your site, and the other
called <code>thalcgi.cgi</code>, which is, well, a CGI :-) &mdash; that is,
a program the web server runs when it handles requests for interactive
features of your site.  When <code>thalcgi.cgi</code> needs to regenerate a
part of your site, e.g. a page with user comments after a new comment is
left there, it also runs <code>thalassa</code>, so you need both of them
for interactivity.  The good news is that they literally <strong>depend on
nothing</strong>, they can even be built statically and uploaded to the
server (in case no C++ compiler is available there; okay, for a VPS it's
never the case, but sometimes you have to use shared hostings despite you
don't want so).
</p>
<p>In its full (interactive-capable) configuration, Thalassa is known to run
with the well-known Apache HTTP server, probably <strong>any</strong>
version of it you can manage to find these days; at least it is known to
work with Apache 1.3.*, which was declared End-Of-Life in 2010.  Certainly
it works with later Apache versions, such as 2.4.* and 2.2.*.  The
<code>mod_cgi</code> module must be loaded from within your Apache
configuration.  Examples and templates provided along with Thalassa also
rely on the <code>mod_rewrite</code> module.  The last but not least, for
the sake of security it is strongly recommended to use
<code>suexec</code>, so that the CGI program runs under a UID different
from the HTTP server's UID, even if you only have one site on your server.
</p>

<h3 id="build">How to build it<p></h3>
</p>
<p>To build Thalassa, just unpack the source tarball, enter the directory and
type <code>make</code> (or <code>gmake</code>, if you're on a BSD-like
system), like this:
</p>
<pre>
  tar -xzf thalassa_0.1.0.tgz
  cd thalassa_0.1.0
  make
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>and then wait a minute.  Both <code>thalassa</code> and
<code>thalcgi.cgi</code> binaries will be found in the <code>cms/</code>
subdirectory, which also contains the source code.
</p>
<p>In case you have an older gcc compiler, such as gcc 4.* or earlier, it is
necessary to remove some command line flags which actually disable certain
(idiotic) &ldquo;new features&rdquo; of later gcc versions.  In this case, instead of
just <code>make</code>, issue the following command:
</p>
<pre>
  make CC=gcc CXX=g++
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>By default, both binaries are built <em>statically linked</em> and
<em>stripped</em>.  If this is not what you want, add <code>STATIC=</code>
to the command line of <code>make</code>, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  make STATIC=
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>or, if you still want them stripped, like this:
</p>
<pre>
  make STATIC=-s
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The libraries of Thalassa itself (these found under the <code>lib/</code>
subdirectory) are statically linked into the binaries anyway, because these
libs are never built as shared objects.
Your dynamic binaries will therefore only depend on &ldquo;system&rdquo; libs such as
libc, libgcc, libstdc++, linux-vdso and the like, so the binaries' size
only shrinks about 3-4 times; this may be not so bad, but it makes the
binaries totally unportable (most of people aroud think it's the norm, but
we disagree).
</p>


<h3 id="workflow">The workflow<p></h3>
</p>
<p>The <code>thalassa</code> program can generate a whole site or some parts of
it, as requested by its command line arguments.  The content of the site
being generated is determined by <em>sources</em> prepared by the
webmaster.  The sources must include one or more configuration files in <a href="ini_basics.html">ini format</a>.  Also the sources may (but not
necessarily do) include text files that represent sets of similarly
formatted pages (one file per page, or a directory with a main file and
auxilliary files such as images, to generate a page with files) and
comments (one file per comment).  Both page set source files and comment
source files together are referred to as &ldquo;database&rdquo;, despite that this
has nothing to do with any DBMSes, Sql and the like; usually the database
for Thalassa is simply a directory with subdirectories containing files
(mainly plain text files, but there can be files of any type as auxilliary
files to generated pages).  Each page and comment file may have its own
format and <a href="headed_text.html#encodings">character encoding</a>.
</p>
<p>The last kind of the sources is directories or individual files to be
copied into the docroot of your site &ldquo;as is&rdquo;.  These files may even be
linked or symlinked instead of being copied, which is useful for large
files such as videos, software archives etc.
</p>
<p>For a site with no interactive features, that's almost all.  You just
prepare the source files, run <code>thalassa</code> and your site is ready.
</p>
<p>Interactive-capable sites need the <code>thalassa.cgi</code> binary to be
placed into the site's docroot, together with its configuration file
<code>thalassa.ini</code>, which must be placed in the same directory and
made unreadable for anyone but the user under which the CGI will run.
Typically this means you need to configure and run <code>suexec</code>, so
that <code>thalassa.cgi</code> runs with a uid different from the HTTP
server's uid.
</p>
<p>The CGI program has its own database, known as <em id="session_database">session database</em>, which may be placed outside of
the docroot.  You don't need to prepare it anyhow, all you need is to
create a directory and make it writable for the user under which the CGI
works.  This directory will be used to store session information, user
accounts, premoderation queue and a spool directory for pages that need to
be regenerated.  The main <code>thalassa</code> program only uses the spool
directory, and only when it is explicitly instructed to use it.  Typically
this is the case when <code>thalassa</code> is being launched by the CGI.
</p>
<p>In the present version, the CGI program only operates on comments: you site
visitors can leave new comments, and you as the site's owner can edit the
comments and perform moderation and other administration tasks.
<strong>Pages (unlike comments) can not be created nor edited through the
CGI program</strong>, so you need to edit the corresponding files manually.
</p>
<p>Certainly it is more convenient to edit the files on your own computer
rather than on the server; but this raises the question of uploading your
changes to the server.  Practice shows that the most convenient way to do
so is using a verion control system such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a>; this way you can also
transfer new comments (and all the changes made to comment files through
the CGI interface) back from the server to your workstation, having a
fully-functional copy of your site locally.  However, definitely this is
not required, you can, e.g., simply copy the modified files to the server
using whatever access method you have.
