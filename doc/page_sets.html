<h2 id="overview">What are page sets<p></h2>
</p>
<p>A <em>page set</em> is basically a directory within your sources (the so
called <em>page set directory</em>), in which you create a <a href="headed_text.html">headed text file</a> or a subdirectory containing
such file, and on the next generator run the file becomes an HTML page
within your site.  Sometimes it may be important that no modifications to
your configuration files (ini files) is needed to add another page to the
set; e.g., such addition can easily be done programmatically, without human
intervention at all.
</p>
<p>If a page is represented by a directory (as opposite to file), the
directory can contain additional files, such as images.  These files will
be published, much like a
<a href="verbatim_publishing.html#collection">collection</a>.
</p>
<p>There are some limitations for this kind of Thalassa objects, the most
notable are the following:</p>
<ul>

<li>pages of the same set are always created in the same directory of your
site's tree; each page is either created as an HTML file or as a directory
containing <code>index.html</code> (this name can be changed, but the
overall structure can not);</li>

<li>from Thalassa's point of view, page sets as such are unordered, so
there's no possibility to enumerate members of a set in predictable manner;
building lists of set pages involves additional files and configuration
objects (well, <a href="lists.html">lists</a> of the &ldquo;set-based source&rdquo;
kind).</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Set pages may have <a href="comment_sections.html">comment sections</a>.
</p>
<p>By default, if a set page's source is a directory, it is generated as a
subdirectory of the target directory, and if the source is a single file,
the page itself is generated as a file (without making directories), too.
This behaviour can be changed; for any particular set it is possible
to force all its pages to be generated as files right within the target
directory, or to be generated as subdirectories of the target directory,
no matter what type of source is used for each page.
</p>


<h2 id="set_src_dir">Page set source directory and item IDs<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Thalassa scans the directory which is set as a source for a page set, and
thus determines what are the set items.  Directory entries with names
starting with &ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo; (dot; the so-called hidden files) and
&ldquo;<code>_</code>&rdquo; (underscore) are ignored during this scan.
</p>
<p class="remark">
Files with names starting with &ldquo;<code>_</code>&rdquo; residing in the page set
source directory are used for various service purposes, primarily to form
<a href="lists.html">lists</a> of set items.
<p></p>
</p>
<p>Entries named starting with anything else are expected to be regular files
and directories; symbolic links are resolved during the file type
examination (and furhter actions), so they can point at files and
directories located elsewhere, if you really need so.  Files of all other
types (devices, FIFOs and sockets) are silently ignored; regular files and
directories found in the set source directory (with appropriate names)
become list items, and their names are taken as item IDs.
</p>
<p>In case a particular item in your page set is represented with a directory,
that directory must contain a file named <code>content.txt</code>; there's no
way to change the name, in the present version it is hardcoded.  This file
will play the role of (the real) source for your page.
</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that your source tree is located at
<code>/home/lizzie/mysite/</code>, and you create a page set with source
directory named <code>node</code>, so its full path will be
<code>/home/lizzie/mysite/node</code>.  If, after that, you want your set
to contain an item named <code>foobar</code>, then you've got two
possibilities:</p>
<ul>

<li>either you create a headed text file with full path
<code>/home/lizzie/mysite/node/foobar</code> (and that's all);</li>

<li>or, you make a <em>directory</em> with full path
<code>/home/lizzie/mysite/node/foobar/</code>, and inside that directory,
create a headed text file named <code>content.txt</code>, so its full path
will be <code>/home/lizzie/mysite/node/foobar/content.txt</code>.  In this
case you can add more files (e.g., images, or whatever else you want) to
the directory along with the <code>content.txt</code>, and these files will
be &ldquo;published&rdquo; into the same place within your site's tree, where the
generated page will reside.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>There's one more thing you should know: file names starting with
&ldquo;<code>_</code>&rdquo; are not only ignored in the page set source directory,
they are also ignored within item directories (where that
<code>content.txt</code> sits), so if you place such a file there, it will
not get published.
</p>
<p class="remark">
In the present version of Thalassa this has no particular meaning, but
files with such names may start playing some special roles later.  As of
now, think of them as &ldquo;reserved&rdquo;.
<p></p>
</p>

<p><strong>The name of the file or directory is taken as the set item
ID</strong>.  The same ID must be given as the value for the
<code>id:</code> header field in the item file; it is unspecified what will
happen in case they don't match (that is, even if in particular version of
Thalassa nothing happens, this can get changed in future versions).
</p>
<p>The set item ID is used in many situations to refer to the particular item,
and the name of whatever is generated (either an HTML file, or a directory
within your site's tree) is also derived from the ID somehow.  Please note
that, unless you intentionally want the dot &ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo; to be in the
ID (and chances are that you don't), you shouldn't use it in the name of
the source file/directory.  For directories this in most cases doesn't make
problems as people are not generally used to add &ldquo;<em>extensions</em>&rdquo; to
directory names; however, for no real reason a lot of people tend to give
&ldquo;extensions&rdquo; to plain files.  Folks, please note one thing: <strong>in
Unix systems, there's no such thing as &ldquo;file name extension&rdquo;</strong>,
and even if you name your file like <code>mypage.txt</code> or
<code>mypage.src</code>, these <code>.txt</code> and <code>.src</code>
ain't no damn &ldquo;extensions&rdquo;, they are just parts of names with no special
meaning of any kind.
</p>
<p>Well, yes, you can name the source file of your page set item something
like <code>mypage.txt</code>, but then the ID of the item will be
<code>mypage.txt</code>, <strong>NOT</strong> <code>mypage</code>, as many
people, for whatever odd reasons, expect.  So it is
<code>mypage.txt</code>, not <code>mypage</code>, what you need to put in
your <code>id:</code> field.  And the page Thalassa generates for you will
likely have name <code>mypage.txt.html</code>, not <code>mypage.html</code>
as you could hope.
</p>
<p>So, at least when you create items in a page set, and you want a single
regular file, not a directory, to be the source of it, <strong>forget about
extensions</strong>.  No matter if it is a file or a directory, name it
just <code>mypage</code> (or how you like), but not
<code>mypage.<em>XXX</em></code>, where <em>XXX</em> is whatever extension
comes to your mind.
</p>


<h2 id="comments">User comments on page set items<p></h2>
</p>
<p>To better understand the rest of this documentation page you should recall
that <strong>set pages are capable of having
<a href="comment_sections.html">comment sections</a></strong>.  Comments,
as well as generation of sections displaying them, will be discussed on the
dedicated page; however, there's one basic property of comment sections we
have to mention right now, otherwise it will be hard to get what the most
of pageset-related configuration parameters are all about.  So, keep in
mind <strong>there may be more than one comment section</strong> for a
single published item (be it an item of a page set, or a list page item) in
case there are more comments than it is desirable to display on one page.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose you write another entry of your blog, and it makes your
readers so much interested that they leave 520 comments, while you
configured Thalassa to display only 100 comments per page.  Actually, 6
pages will have to be generated for your single blog entry in this case:
first 5 of them displaying 100 comments each, and the last displaying 20
comments.
</p>
<p>What Thalassa does in this situation is repeating your item's content, be it a
blog entry or whatever else, on each of the pages generated for that item.
So, in the simplest possible case, the first page will contain your entry
and the first 100 comments, the second page will contain <em>your entry
again</em> and the comments from 101 through 200, etc.  It is possible to
tell Thalassa to display the comments in reverse order, newer first, and
their placement on pages will differ, but the idea is always the same: a
number of pages to be generated for a single source item, the item's
content is displayed on every page, and each page has its own range of
comments.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of this, pageset configuration had to be made a bit
complicated, and it might look confusing on the first glance.  First of
all, a template used for page generation is broken down to two parts, named
<code>page_template</code> and <code>page_tail_template</code>.  Every
generated page consists of three parts: the result of macroprocessing for
<code>page_template</code>, the comment section and the result of
macroprocessing for <code>page_tail_template</code>.  These three parts are
simply concatenated to make the whole page's content.
</p>
<p>The second question is how to name the generated files.  This is a bit
tricky and depends on whether the item being generated has its own
directory.  For an entry named <code>foobar</code> from our example above,
there are two possibilities.  In case the item doesn't have its own
directory, perhaps (relatively to the target directory of the whole set)
the first (main) file will be named just <code>foobar.html</code>, and
additional files (containing pages for the same entry, but dfferent
portions of comments) will be <code>foobar_2.html</code>,
<code>foobar_3.html</code>, ..., <code>foobar_5.html</code>.  In case of a
separate subdirectory, the main file will (by default) be
<code>foobar/index.html</code>, and the additional pages will get names
<code>foobar/c2.html</code>, <code>foobar/c3.html</code>, etc.  In both
cases the main page is considered to be Number One, but the number is
hidden (this changes slightly when the comments are placed in reverse
order; this will be discussed along with
<a href="comment_sections.html">comment sections</a>).
</p>
<p><span id="comment_maps">One</span>
more thing to keep in mind is that sometimes programs need to determine
on which page a particular comment is located.  The <code>thalassa</code>
program during the process of generation has sufficient information to
deduce this, but the CGI program sometimes needs to know this too, and it
has no access to the site sources.  Hence Thalassa generates an additional
file for every item that turned into several pages because of comments; the
file is known as a <em>comment map</em>.
</p>
<p>Knowing all this, it must be easier to understand what some configuration
parameters are for.
</p>




<h2 id="pageset_section">The <code>[pageset&nbsp;]</code> ini file sections<p></h2>
</p>
<p>A page set is configured with an ini file section that belongs to
the <code>pageset</code> group, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
  [pageset node]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The name of the section (<code>node</code> in this example) identifies the
set as a whole.  Both page set source directory and its target directory
default to the pageset name, but this can be overriden by setting
respective parameters.  However, even if you don't use these defaults, and
even if you only have one page set, be sure to give it a good name because
it will likely appear in many other places of your configuration file.
</p>
<p>During the generation period of a set page, Thalassa makes one special
macro available, which gives access to properties of the page being
generated, such as its ID, title, text (body), information from the header
and so
on.  The macro is named <code>%[li:&nbsp;]</code>, for <em>list item</em>;
it is named so because exactly the same macro is used in generation of
<a href="generation_objects.html#lists">list</a> items.  The macro will be
discussed <a href="#li_macro">later</a>, and as of now, just keep in mind
that </p>
<ul>

<li><code>%[li:id]</code> is the ID of the page being generated;</li>

<li><code>%[li:text]</code> is the page's text (well, the body)
<em>after</em> applying all transformations related to
<a href="headed_text.html#encodings">encoding</a> and
<a href="headed_text.html#format">format</a>;</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Now we can discuss parameters that may appear within a
<code>[pageset&nbsp;]</code> section.
</p>
<p>The actual content of generated pages is controlled by two parameters:
<code>page_template</code> and <code>page_tail_template</code>.
Their values are passed through the macroprocessor; then, the generator
concatenates the processing result for <code>page_template</code>, the
comment section (if it exists for the page being generated) and the
processing result of <code>page_tail_template</code>.  The
&ldquo;<code>%[li:&nbsp;]</code>&rdquo; macro must be used to access the content of a
particular page; at the very least, you hardly can go without
<code>%[li:text]</code>.
</p>
<p><span id="page_templ_spec"></span>
You can use different page templates in the same page set.  To do so, add
the &ldquo;<code>type:&nbsp;</code>&rdquo; header to source files of your pages.  For
example, you can use
</p>
<pre>
  type: blog
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>for blog entries,
</p>
<pre>
  type: news
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>for news articles, etc.  Then, these type identifiers (<code>blog</code>
and <code>news</code> in the example, or anything else you want) may be
used as <a href="ini_basics.html#parameter_specifiers">parameter
specifiers</a> for both <code>page_template</code> and
<code>page_tail_template</code>.  For example, you can use
<code>page_template:blog</code> for your blog entries and
<code>page_template</code> with no specifier for everything else.
</p>
<p>The <code>sourcedir</code> parameter sets the path for page set source
directory; as usual, the path may be either absolute or relative, and
&ldquo;relative&rdquo; means relative to Thalassa working directory.  This parameter
defaults to the pageset ID, so if the ID is <code>node</code>, as in our
example above, the <code>sourcedir</code> parameter is not explicitly
specified (that is, omitted) and you run <code>thalassa</code> in
<code>/home/lizzie/mysite/</code>, then it takes items for your set from
<code>/home/lizzie/mysite/node/</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>setdirname</code> parameter tells <code>thalassa</code> where to
place the items it generates.  The value is taken relative to your site's
tree root, even if it begins with a slash &ldquo;<code>/</code>&rdquo;.  Just like
the previous parameter, <code>setdirname</code> defaults
to the pageset ID.
</p>
<p>The <code>make_subdirs</code> parameter controls whether to make
subdirectories within the <code>setdirname</code> directory for each item.
The recognized values are <code>always</code>, <code>never</code> and
<code>bysource</code>, which is the default.  In case parameter is omitted,
empty or its value is not recognized, it is taken as if it was
<code>bysource</code>.  The value is case-insensitive; <code>always</code>
means to make subdirectories for all items, even for items whose source is
a single file; <code>never</code> means not to make any subdirs even for
items whose source is a directory with <code>content.txt</code> (and
possibly other files) in it, and the default <code>bysource</code> means to
create subdirs only for items whose source is a directory.
</p>
<p><strong>For items generated as a file, without a subdirectory</strong>, the
<code>pagefilename</code> parameter sets the file name template.  The
template should usually contain <code>%[li:id]</code> macro call, so that
the name of the file contains the item ID, but this is not enforced in any
way, and it is possible (at least in theory) to use other techniques to
make the files have different names.  Besides all macros defined in
<code>thalassa</code>, the <code>pagefilename</code> parameter can use the
<a href="common_macros.html#idx_macros"><em>index macros</em></a>
(<code>%idx%</code>, <code>%_idx%</code> and <code>%idx0%</code>),
which reflex <em>index</em> of a comment
page (generated for the same item).  The &ldquo;main&rdquo; page always has special
index value &mdash; zero, even if it is considered &ldquo;invisible number
one&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Parameter defaults to &ldquo;<code>%[li:id]%[_idx].html</code>&rdquo;; you can safely
omit it in most cases.
</p>
<p><strong>For items generated with their own subdirectories</strong>, the
<code>pagefilename</code> parameter is ignored.  Instead, three other
parameters are used:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>pagedirname</code> sets the name for the subdirectory to be
created for the item; default is &ldquo;<code>%[li:id]</code>&rdquo;;</li>

<li><code>indexfilename</code> sets the name for the HTML file created
inside the directory to represent the item; default is
&ldquo;<code>index.html</code>&rdquo; &mdash; please note this is the name of file
displayed by Apache by default when directory URI is requested;</li>

<li><code>compagename</code> is a template for names of additional HTML
files, created because of multiple comment sections; index macros work
within the value of this parameter; default is
&ldquo;<code>c%idx%.html</code>&rdquo;.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>

<p>The <code>comments</code> parameter sets the comment sections style, the
path to the comment tree (the part of the &ldquo;database&rdquo; that holds comments
for the particular page) and some additional parameters available
in comment-related templates by macro calls.  This parameter is closely
discussed along with <a href="comment_sections.html">comment sections</a>.
By default this parameter's value is empty, which means no comment section
to be generated.
</p>
<p>The <code id="#param_commentmap">commentmap</code> parameter is a template for
<a href="#comment_maps">comment map file names</a>.  The name is relative
to your rootdir (the root directory of your site's tree).  As of present
version, the default is empty, which means not to create map files (for a
given page set) at all.  However, please note some important functions of
the CGI program will not work without maps, in case you use comment styles
that involve a maximum of comments per page (and multiple pages in case
there are more comments).  Something like
&ldquo;<code>node/.__%[li:id].map</code>&rdquo; will work; you can also make a
dedicated directory for all your maps, even outside of your tree (because
the value may start with &ldquo;<code>../</code>&rdquo; and there's no limitation for
this), although comment maps don't hold any sensitive information and can
perhaps be safely left inside your web tree.
</p>
<p>If you want the map file names to be constructed differently for the pages
generated as a directory and the pages generated without directories, you
can specify <code>commentmap:nodir</code> separately, and it will be used
for pages without directories, while the value of <code>commentmap</code>
will in this case be used for separate-dir pages only.
</p>
<p>Besides all that, <code>[pageset&nbsp;]</code> sections can contain all
parameters responsible for
<a href="verbatim_publishing.html#publish_methods">publishing methods</a>,
that is, <code>publish_method</code>, <code>publish_symlinks</code>,
<code>publish_hidden</code>, <code>publish_recursive</code> and
<code>chmod</code>.  They control how additional files (for the set
items sourced as directories) are getting into your web tree.  Follow the link
for the description.
</p>



<h2 id="header_fields">Header fields having special meaning<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Since every item of a page set is initially represented as a
<a href="headed_text.html">headed text file</a>, it is important to know
what header fields are recognized by Thalassa and how they influence on the
process of generation.
</p>
<p>As it is <a href="headed_text.html#structure">mentioned</a> in the general
description of headed files used in Thalassa, three fields are used by the
parser internally and are not accessible outside.  These are
<code>id</code>, <code>encoding</code> and <code>format</code>.
</p>
<p>For page set items, the fields <code>unixtime</code>, <code>type</code>,
<code>flags</code>, <code>comments</code>, <code>teaser_len</code>,
<code>descr</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>title</code> and
<code>tags</code> are recognized by Thalassa, which means their processing
is <em>special</em> in at least some sense.
</p>
<p>First of all, the fields <code>unixtime</code>, <code>type</code>,
<code>flags</code>, <code>comments</code> and <code>teaser_len</code> don't
get processed by format and/or encoding filters.  Contrary to this, the
<code>descr</code> field gets full processing, both for encoding and
format, just like the body of the page.  All the other fields, including
those not listed, only get processed for encoding, but not for the format.
</p>
<p>Please remember that <strong>in case a field is entered by a user, and you
display it on your pages, it is necessary to pass its contents through a
filter that strips off all tags and &amp;-entities to avoid HTML
injections</strong>.  Thalassa won't do that for you authomatically,
because it doesn't know if a particular field is entered by third parties,
nor if you're going to display it on a HTML page; but it provides
<a href="common_macros.html#macro_ltgt">the <code>%[ltgt:&nbsp;]</code>
macro</a> for this purpose, so be sure to use it.
</p>
<p>The <code id="hf_unixtime">unixtime</code> field, if it is present, must be
an integer representing a date (presumably, the date when the page was
created), as the well-known Unix Time value (the number of seconds since
Jan 01, 1970).
</p>
<p>The <code id="hf_type">type</code> field, if it is there, should contain an
identifier used as a <a href="#page_templ_spec">specifier</a> for your
<code>page_template</code> and <code>page_tail_template</code>.  We'd like
to repeat it one more time that no encoding transformation is applied to
this field, and Thalassa itself is mostly codepage-agnostic, so you'd
better not try using any non-ASCII chars (and, even further, no chars other
than lowercase latin letters, digits and the underscore) in this field.
</p>
<p class="remark">Those familiar with Drupal might notice this field is
designed to handle these Drupal's <em>node types</em>.  If you never had to
deal with Drupal, you're, first of all, lucky, and, second, you don't want
to know more about the <code>type</code> field.<p></p>
</p>
<p>The <code id="hf_flags">flags</code> field is designed to contain a
comma-separated list of identifiers, of which, in the present version, only
one is used by Thalassa itself.  This flag is <code>hidden</code>, and it
makes Thalssa simply skip generation of the page.  So, if your source
file's header contains
</p>
<pre>
  flags: hidden
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>or even something like
</p>
<pre>
  flags: abra, hidden, cadabra, schwabra
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>then your page will not be generated, as if it didn't exist at all.
</p>


<p>The <code>comments</code> field determines whether comments are available
for this page.  Possible values are <code>enabled</code>
<code>disabled</code> and <code>readonly</code>, and <code>disabled</code>
is the default; actually, any other value is silently considered equal to
<code>disabled</code>.  The <code>thalassa</code> program only tries to
generate the comment section in case this field contains either
<code>enabled</code> or <code>readonly</code>, otherwise it concatenates
the two parts of the page template inserting nothing between them, even if
your &ldquo;database&rdquo; contains comments for this page.  As of the CGI program,
if it is configured properly, it will only allow comments for pages that
have <code>enabled</code> in this field (and if it is not properly
configured, then chances are it will not allow comments at all, but your
mileage may vary).
</p>

<p>The <code id="hf_teaser_len">teaser_len</code> and
<code id="hf_descr">descr</code> fields are both meant to
provide a shorter version of the page to be included in lists, be it named
a <em>description</em> or <em>teaser</em>.  It is a bit tricky to explain
how exactly they work.  In case the <code>descr</code> field is given and
isn't empty, the <code>teaser_len</code> field is completely ignored.
Otherwise Thalassa considers the first <em>N</em> bytes (that's it! not
characters, but bytes, so utf8 lovers can have a trouble here... well, in
case they try to compute the value manually, which it was never intended
for) of the body
to be the &ldquo;<em>description</em>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;teaser&rdquo;, no matter), where
<em>N</em> is the integral number given as the value for
<code>teaser_len</code>.  If this number happens to be greater than the
body's length, then the whole body is taken as the description.  Some
obvious troubles can arise in case some HTML tags open within the
&ldquo;teaser&rdquo; but get closed after its end.
</p>
<p>The <code id="hf_date">date</code> field should contain <em>the date</em>
(presumably, again, the date when the page was created) in some
human-readable format.  In case it is present, it will be displayed as the
date; otherwise, Thalassa will <em>somehow</em> convert the
<a href="#hf_unixtime"><code>unixtime</code></a> field to a human-readable
form.  Actually, in the present version the rfc2822 date format is used
(see the <a ref="common_macro.html#macro_rfcdate">rfcdate macro</a> for
explanation), and it's even impossible to set the timezone, it is always
UTC.  This is <strong>very likely</strong> to change.
</p>
<p>The <code id="hf_title">title</code> field is just that: a title.  If some
of you prefer the term &ldquo;<em>subject</em>&rdquo;, we're really glad for you.
</p>
<p>The <code id="hf_tags">tags</code> field contains a comma-separated list
of, well, tags.  No special handling is done for them, but there's a macro
you can use to determine if a particular tag is there or not.
</p>





<h2 id="li_macro">The <code>%[li:&nbsp;]</code> macro<p></h2>
</p>
<p>As already mentioned above, <code>li</code> stands for <em>list item</em>,
which is because it is used with <a href="lists.html">lists</a>, too, and,
even more, sometimes page set items serve as list items theirselves.  The
<code>li</code> macro is available during the <em>time period</em> of a
particular set item generation, which means you can use it in your
<code>page_template</code> and <code>page_tail_template</code> parameters,
as well as in all things &ldquo;called&rdquo; from them, like snippets defined in the
<code>[html]</code> configuration section.
</p>
<p>The macro accepts at least one argument, and often more.  The first
argument determines what you actually want from the macro; we'll call these
names &ldquo;functions&rdquo;; please note we already know two of the functions:
<code>id</code> and <code>text</code>.  Let's repeat that
<code>id</code> returns the set item ID (hereinafter, &ldquo;returns&rdquo;
effectively means that the macro call <code>%[li:id]</code> or the like is
replaced with the ID), and <code>text</code> returns your
item's body.  Until the end of this section, we'll use phrases like
&ldquo;the <code>mumbo</code> function returns <em>jumbo</em>&rdquo; in the sense that
macro call <code>%[li:mumbo:&nbsp;]</code> (possibly with more than one
argument) is macro-expanded to a thing explained by &ldquo;<em>jumbo</em>&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Besides the two, the most obvious functions are (likely):</p>
<ul>

<li><code>title</code> &mdash; returns the title, as it is set by the
<a href="#hf_title"><code>title</code></a> header field; are you surprized?
</li>

<li><code>unixtime</code> returns the
<a href="#hf_unixtime"><code>unixtime</code></a> field, if it exists and is a
valid number, oterwise returns an empty string;
</li>

<li><code>date</code> returns the date in human-readable form, either as
defined by the <a href="#hf_date"><code>date</code></a> field, or derived
from the <code>unixtime</code> field;
</li>

<li><code>descr</code> returns the shorter version of the page text, as set
by <a href="#hf_teaser_len"><code>teaser_len</code></a> and
<a href="#hf_descr">descr</code></a> fields;
</li>

<li><code>tags</code> returns a comma-separated list of tags set by the
<a href="#hf_tags">tags</code></a> field; this list may differ from the actual
field's contents <em>as a string</em>, because internally the tags are
stored separately, and the whole string is reconstructed when requested by
the macro;
</li>

<li id="li_func_hf"><code>hf</code>
(for <em>header field</em>) takes a name of a header
field as an additional agrument, and returns its value &mdash; that is,
<code>%[li:hf:<em>NAME</em>]</code> returns the value of the header named
<em>NAME</em>; please note this only works for header fields not recognized
by Thalassa itself, which means you can't get the value of your title or
unixtime this way.
</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Several functions of the <code>li</code> macro allow to check certain
condition and choose one of two strings depending on it.  They may accept
one or more arguments for the condition itself (but most of them don't, as
the condition is fully defined by the function itself), and two more
arguments as the alternatives to return (i.e., &ldquo;then&rdquo; and &ldquo;else&rdquo;
alternative).  For example, <code>ifcomenabled</code> checks whether
comments are enabled or not on the page, which means the condition is true
if (and only if) the <code>comments</code> field contains the word
<code>enable</code>.  So,
</p>
<pre>
  %[li:ifcomenabled:%[html:cmt_form]:&lt;em&gt;comments disabled&lt;/em&gt;]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>on pages where comments are enabled, will expand to whatever
<code>%[html:cmt_form]</code> expands to, while on pages where comments are
not enabled (that is, either disabled or readonly), it will expand to
the string &ldquo;<code>&lt;em&gt;comments disabled&lt;/em&gt;</code>&rdquo;.
</p>
<p><strong>WARNING!  Be sure to read
<a href="macro_intro.html#eager_and_consequences">the section devoted to
eager computational model and its consequences</a>.  </strong>
In this particular example, the <code>%[html:cmt_form]</code> call will be
expanded in any case, that is, even if comments aren't enabled, it will
expand anyway, but the result of the expansion will be dropped.  Sometimes
this isn't a problem, but it is necessary to understand what actually
happens, or else you'll run into problems, sooner or later.
</p>
<p>For the particular example, the obvious solution will be to write
</p>
<pre>
  %[html:%[li:ifcomenabled:cmt_form:com_disabled]]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>and to define the snippet named <code>com_disabled</code> in your
<code>[html]</code> configuration section like this:
</p>
<pre>
  [html]
  com_disabled = &lt;em&gt;comments disabled&lt;/em&gt;
  cmt_form = ...
  ...
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>The <code>iffile</code> macro checks if the set item directory contains a
file with the given name among the files to be published.  It takes three
arguments, for the file name, &ldquo;then&rdquo; and &ldquo;else&rdquo;.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
  %[li:iffile:photo.png:
     &lt;img src="photo.png" alt="the photo"/&gt;
     :
     &lt;strong&gt;No photo&lt;/strong&gt;
  ]
<p></pre>
</p>

<p>The <code>li</code> macro also supports some functions intended to be used
with lists; some of them may (in rare curcumstances) be useful in sets that
don't act as source for any lists, but it would be hard to explain them
without the lists-related background anyway.  These functions are:
<code>prev</code>,
<code>next</code>,
<code>ifprev</code>,
<code>ifnext</code>,
<code>iflong</code>,
<code>ifmore</code>,
<code>listarraynum</code>,
<code>iflistarraynum</code>,
<code>listidx</code>,
<code>iflistidx</code>.  We'll discuss them along
<a href="lists.html#li_macro">with the lists</a>.
</p>
<p>If the second argument doesn't match any functions known to the macro, it
expands to <code>[li:<em>ARG</em>?!]</code>, where <em>ARG</em> it the
second parameter's value.
