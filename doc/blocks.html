<h2 id="whatfor">What blocks and block groups are and what they are for<p></h2>
</p>
<p>When a site has a lot of pages, there almost always are some little things
you want to display on every page, like a common header, and actually
that's what static generators are all about.  With Thalassa, this is
achieved easily because all pages are generated using a limited number of
templates, and, furthermore, these templates, despite they may differ, may
be (and usually are) built on common HTML snippets.  So, it is easy to
insert some content into <em>all</em> your pages.
</p>
<p>Things become a little more complicated when you've got some content to
display on <em>many</em> pages but not on <em>all</em> of them.  This is
what blocks are for.
</p>
<p>First of all, define one or more <em>block groups</em>, each one
corresponding to a place in your page layout where you want some common
pieces of content to appear.  For example, you can define a group for your
side panel (well, should you have both left and right side panels on your
site, you'll need two block groups, but you don't have two side panels, do
you?), another group for your ceiling, one more group to have some
microblocks within your site's header &mdash; well, you've got the idea.
Technically a block group is a named object that consists of three
templates: for the begin and the end of the code that displays the group,
and for blocks themselves.
</p>
<p>Once your groups are ready, insert them into your templates that define
layout of your pages; this is done by calling the
<code>%[blocks:&nbsp;]</code> macro.
</p>
<p>The next step is to define your blocks.  Each block has a name, consists of
a title and a body, and may also have a <em>tag</em>; you can assign
<em>weight</em> values to your blocks to arrange them within their block
group (the more the weight is, the later that block appears within its
group).
</p>
<p>Finally, take care about what blocks appear on each of your pages.  If a
block has no tag, it will appear in every existing instance of the group it
belongs to.  If the tag is set, the block will only appear on pages where
this tag is either specified for the page itself (by the <code>tags:</code>
header field of a page set item source, or by the <code>tags</code>
parameter within a list item ini section), or given in the third argument
passed to the <code>%[blocks:&nbsp;]</code> macro call.
</p>


<h2 id="blockgroup_section">The <code>[blockgroup&nbsp;]</code> section<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Block groups are defined by ini file sections of the
<code>blockgroup</code> section group, with section headers like
</p>
<pre>
  [blockgroup <em>NAME</em>]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>&mdash; where <em id="blockgroup_name">NAME</em> is the block group name.
The name is used in block definitions to bind blocks to groups, and as the
second argument in <a href="#blocks_macro"><code>%[blocks:&nbsp;]</code>
macro</a> calls to identify the group.
</p>
<p>Three parameters are recognized within these sections:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>begin</code> &mdash; defines the HTML code snippet that starts
the block group;</li>

<li><code>end</code> &mdash; defines the HTML code snippet that ends
the block group;</li>

<li><code>block_template</code> &mdash; defines the template used to
generate HTML code for every block in the group.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>All parameters are passed through the macroprocessor; within the
<code>block_template</code> parameter's value, an additional
macro named <code>blk</code> is available to provide
access to the title and the body of the block being generated.
In the present version of Thalassa this macro has four functions:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>%[blk:title]</code> returns the block's title;</li>

<li><code>%[blk:body]</code> is replaced with the block's body;</li>

<li><code>%[blk:id]</code> returns the block's ID (the name of the
corresponding <code>[block&nbsp;]</code> section);</li>

<li><code>%[blk:tag]</code> returns the tag set for the block, or empty
string if the block has no tag.</li>

<p></ul>
</p>

<h2 id="block_section">The <code>[block&nbsp;]</code> section<p></h2>
</p>
<p>Ini file sections of the <code>block</code> section group are used
to define individual blocks; so, a block definition starts with a header of
the form
</p>
<pre>
  [block <em>ID</em>]
<p></pre>
</p>
<p>Be sure to give each block a distinct <em>ID</em>.  Being distinct is in
fact the only role for these <em>ID</em>s; they can be accessed from
within the <code>block_template</code> parameter of the corresponding
<code>blockgroup</code> ini section, but it is not necessary to use them
this way, and there are no other ways at all.
</p>
<p>The following parameters are recognized:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>title</code> &mdash; the title of the block (the text to be
returned by <code>%[blk:title]</code>);</li>

<li><code>body</code> &mdash; the body of the block (the text to be
returned by <code>%[blk:body]</code>);</li>

<li><code>group</code> &mdash; the name of the block group this block is to
belong to;</li>

<li><code>tag</code> &mdash; the tag; may be omitted or left empty, which
means the block will be displayed in all instances of its group;</li>

<li><code>weight</code> &mdash; the integral number (negatives are okay),
which determines the position of the block within its group (the more the
weight is, the later the block appears).</li>

<p></ul>
</p>
<p>Only the values of <code>title</code> and <code>body</code> are passed
through the macroprocessor; the rest of the parameters aren't.
</p>




<h2 id="blocks_macro">The <code>%[blocks:&nbsp;]</code> macro<p></h2>
</p>
<p>The <code>%[blocks:&nbsp;]</code> macro is intended to be used within
templates that form your pages' layout.  The macro accepts two arguments;
first of them is the <a href="#blockgroup_name">name</a> of the block group
to be displayed, and the second is a comma-separated list of tags, possibly
empty.
</p>
<p>Being called, the macro composes the requested block group and returns the
resulting HTML code.  Each block of these belonging to the given group is
displayed if either its <em>tag</em> is empty, or it is found in the list
passed as the third parameter, or the macro is being called from within
a context where a <em>list item</em> is available (that is, the page being
generated is either a <a href="page_sets.html">page set item</a>, or a
<a href="lists.html#list_item_pages">list item page</a> for an ini-sourced
list), and the block's tag is in the list item's array of tags.
